In addition to being holy or unholy, the affected substance is purified of any mundane spoilage. 1 Cure Light Wounds At your touch, wounds mend, and bones cease to ache. Heal an ally you touch of d8 damage. 1 Detect Alignment When you cast this spell, choose an alignment: Follower of the Saint, Neutral to the Saint, Antithetical to the Saint. One of your senses is briefly able to detect that alignment. The GM will tell you what there is of that alignment. 1 Invigorate One ally you touch is cured of fainting, lethargy, paralysis, or unconsciousness, and you can instantly move again. 1 Mending Your devotion allows you to fix some mundane object without needing tools or expertise. 1 Planning OngoingCast this spell when you devise a plan to approach a  situation. When you carry out that plan, gain +1 forward. You can only have a heightened understanding of one plan at a time. 1 Sanctuary As you cast this spell, you walk the perimeter of an area, consecrating it to your deity.
