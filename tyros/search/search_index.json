Good luck, adventurer!","title":"Step 6: Introductions"},{"location":"2%20Equipment/","text":"Equipment The equipment your character carries defines their role and specialty in the group. Inventory slots Your character has 12 inventory slots to carry items in 2 hand slots, 4 body slots, and 6 backpack slots. Hand Slots : Items being held, such as weapons, shields, and torches. Body Slots : Items worn for immediate access during combat, like secondary weapons or ammunition for ranged weapons. Armor and helmets also take up body slots. Backpack Slots : Items in these slots take a little time to retrieve. While in combat, you must use an action (instead of attacking) to fetch an item from your pack. Most items take up one inventory slot. Some bulky items, such as armor and group equipment kits, take up two slots. Smaller items may be bundled into a single slot at the GM\u2019s discretion. Your character can\u2019t carry more items than their inventory allows. Carts, horses, or mules can increase inventory space. Hirelings can also be employed to haul your equipment. Coins Your character can carry up to 50 coins freely in their pockets. After that, each additional 200 coins occupy one inventory slot. Burdens Burdens are adverse conditions your character suffers, such as Injured or Frightened . Complications from failed checks or events in the narrative can inflict burdens. Each burden must be placed in an inventory slot. You can have multiple copies of the same burden. If there aren\u2019t enough inventory slots for a new burden, an item must be dropped to make room. Some burdens have additional adverse effects. These effects apply as long as the burden remains in your inventory. Conditions can be removed only by meeting their clear requirement, usually a short, long, or full rest. Example Burdens Condition Adverse Effect Cleared After Dazed Disadvantage on WIL checks Long rest Deprived Can\u2019t heal from resting Meal and long rest Frightened Make a WIL check to approach the source of fear Short rest Injured Disadvantage on STR and DEX checks Full rest Note : See the \u201cHow to Play\u201d section for information about attribute checks and disadvantages. Hirelings A pair of helping hands might give you the edge you\u2019ll need to survive or, at the very least, carry more equipment. In many settlements, especially larger ones, you can find people willing to explore the world with you. Torchbearer (1 coin/day): 2 HP, 9 STR, 9 DEX, 9 WIL. Torch. Guard (3 coins/day): 4 HP, 10 STR, 10 DEX, 10 WIL. Spear, Shield. Sellsword (6 coins/day): 6 HP, 12 STR, 10 DEX, 10 WIL. Sword, Light Armor, Shield. Expert (10 coins/day): 3 HP, 10 STR, 10 DEX, 12 WIL. Crossbow, Helmet, Specific Expertise. In addition to a daily wage, hirelings must be fed and provided lodging. Hireling Morale When a hireling faces a stressful situation, is made to go without pay or food, or is asked to do something more dangerous than what they signed on for, they must make a WIL check or flee. Well-paid or loyal hirelings may make this check with an advantage. Hireling Advancement Hirelings can improve in the same way that your character does. Hirelings who receive a share of treasure gain 1 XP per coin above their daily wage. Like your character, once they earn 1000 XP, they advance to Level 2. Not receiving a share of treasure may cause resentment amongst hirelings. Usage Most items have three uses as an abstract method to track resource consumption or wear and tear on adventuring gear. After all three uses are marked, the item is depleted, broken, or destroyed. Usage can be repaired on things such as weapons and armor for 10% of the original cost per use removed. Weapons, armor, and ammunition : After a fight, roll d6 for each item used during the battle. On 5-6 , mark a usage. Other equipment : If used in a way that could break or deplete it, the GM may ask you to mark usage. Weapons Some weapons have characteristics that affect their use. Ammo : Long- and short-range weapons require the listed ammunition to be carried in a body slot. STR : Using the weapon requires the minimum Strength attribute score. If STR is less than the requirement, the damage is Impaired. Long-range : This weapon can attack a target up to three zones away. Short-range : This weapon can attack a target up to 2 zones away. Attacks 3 zones away are Impaired. Thrown : This weapon can attack a target in the same zone or be thrown at a target in an adjacent zone. Two-handed : This weapon takes up both hand slots. Versatile : This weapon has two entries noted under damage; it deals the first wielded with one hand and adds bonus damage wielded with two (roll both, take the best).

The GM describes the players\u2019 current situation. Then the players ask questions and tell the GM what their characters do. The GM explains the results of their actions, and then the players react again and describe more activities, and so on. The GM answers your questions and always respects your freedom of choice. The GM provides challenges, obstacles, and situations to solve and overcome. Still, the game is more than just a story narrated by the GM\u2014it\u2019s an interactive fiction built on your and your fellow players\u2019 decisions. Consider it as both creating and acting in an adventure story simultaneously. Suppose the outcome of your character\u2019s actions is not immediately apparent, or the activity is inherently risky. In that case, the GM might ask you to roll dice to determine the results. Attribute Checks When you describe your character doing something risky, or the outcome is uncertain, the GM may ask you to make an attribute check . Roll a d20 and compare the result to the applicable attribute score. If the result is less than or equal to the relevant attribute score, your character succeeds and suffers no consequences. If the result exceeds the score, your character fails and suffers the outcome described by the GM. Using Attributes Your character is a determined, resourceful adventurer, capable of trying almost anything. So when the outcome is risky, and the GM calls for an attribute check, how do we determine which attribute to roll against? Your description of the action determines the applicable attribute. Consider a locked castle door\u2014how do you pass through it? If you break out a crowbar and try to force it open, that\u2019s a STR check. If you use a lock pick to unlock the door, that\u2019s a DEX check. If you want to bribe a guard to open it, that\u2019s a WIL check. Don\u2019t think about what your character is capable of, but how they would approach a problem. Play to all of your character\u2019s assets. Critical Successes and Failures Rolling the exact attribute score on a check is a critical success, and the outcome will be better than expected. Increase your LUCK attribute score by 1. Conversely, rolling a 20 is a critical failure, and the outcome will be worse than expected. Decrease your LUCK by 1. Advantage and Disadvantage If you roll a check and are particularly well prepared or equipped, the GM may allow you to roll with an advantage. Roll two d20s and take the best result. If you are in a dire position or ill-prepared for your task, the GM may ask you to roll with a disadvantage. Roll two d20s and take the worst result. Luck Luck applies only to player characters, not hirelings, monsters, or any other non-player characters controlled by the GM. You can decrease (burn) your LUCK to change the dice rolls for an attribute check. Add or remove the amount of LUCK you want to burn from the result. Be warned: running out of LUCK (the score becoming zero) will cause all your dice rolls to have a disadvantage and possibly other detrimental effects. LUCK can\u2019t be less than zero. The GM may sometimes call for a LUCK check if an outcome is random and your other attributes don\u2019t apply. Time The game measures time in three durations: Round is the time scale for combat. Each round is around 10 seconds. Turn is the time scale for exploration. Each turn is around 10 minutes, enough time to explore a room and perform an Action or two. Watch is the time scale used when traveling. Each Watch is 6 hours: morning, afternoon, evening, and night. A party can travel 6 miles in 1 watch in open terrain and clear weather. Distances and Zones The game uses zones as abstractions of distance and area to divide larger physical spaces into smaller units, like rooms in a house. For example, at the start of combat, the GM divides the battlefield into at least three zones; one where the party starts, one where the enemies start, and the area between them. The distance within and between zones is relative: Close : Within the same zone. You can touch it. Most actions affect things in your zone. You can speak softly and be heard. In range of melee weapons. Near : One zone away. You can get to it. You can speak and be heard. In range of thrown weapons. Far : Two zones away. You can shoot at it. You can shout and be heard. In range for short-range weapons. Distant : Three zones away. You can see it. Too far away for verbal communication. In range for long-range weapons. Combat Combat is dangerous, and wise adventurers seek to avoid it. Still, sometimes conflict is inevitable. Initiative If you attack unsuspecting foes, your character and any allies aware of the plan go first. Otherwise, make a DEX or WIL check to act before your opponents. In following combat rounds, maintain this order. Actions On your turn in a combat round, your character can move to an adjacent zone and take an action. Actions can range from attacking, moving again, tripping or disarming an opponent, negotiating, or anything else within reason. Attacks Attacks always hit . Roll your weapon\u2019s damage die or dice (refer to the weapons list) and do that much damage to an opponent minus their armor. Remember, this is also true for your opponents; their attacks always hit you. Bonus Damage In some situations, attacks may receive an extra die, noted as +d6, +d8, etc. Roll the extra die with your weapon\u2019s damage roll, keeping the best result. For example, attacks against helpless or unaware targets receive +d12 bonus damage. Impaired Attacks When an attack is impaired, such as firing into cover or fighting while your hands are bound, roll the +d4 damage and use the worst result. Critical Hits Rolling the maximum damage on a weapon\u2019s die roll is a critical hit. A critical hit ignores the target\u2019s armor and deals the total damage. Dual-Wielding If attacking with two weapons, one in your main hand and one offhand, roll damage for both and choose the best result. Multiple Attackers If multiple combatants attack the same target, all attackers roll their damage but keep only the best result. Ranged Attacks Ranged weapons can\u2019t be used if you\u2019re in the same zone as your target. Aiming Not moving and using an action to aim instead of attacking allows a character to ignore the target\u2019s armor with a ranged weapon the next round. Blast Attacks with the blast quality affect all targets in the zone, rolling damage separately for each affected combatant. Blast refers to anything from fireballs, massive cleaving onslaughts, and a swarm of tiny creatures. If unsure how many targets can be affected in the zone, roll the weapon\u2019s damage die for the number. Subdual Rather than inflicting grievous harm, you can attempt to subdue an opponent using a melee weapon. Ranged weapons can\u2019t subdue. Declare that you\u2019re trying to subdue and then attack as usual but halve the damage. An opponent who would suffer critical damage or death from a subdual attack is instead knocked unconscious. Gambits Gambits are combat maneuvers such as stunning, shoving, disarming, tripping, or sundering armor. They\u2019re resolved with a check by the combatant most at risk. Gambits can\u2019t cause damage directly but may do so indirectly (for example, pushing an enemy off a ledge). Advantage in Combat Characters can gain an advantage in combat by attacking a target on lower ground, off balance, disarmed, distracted, or tactically disadvantaged in any significant way. When a character has an advantage against an opponent on their combat turn, they can apply advantage to either their damage roll or a gambit against that opponent. Alternatively, you can make an attack and a gambit attempt against that opponent without an advantage in the same round. If you apply advantage to your damage roll, roll only your weapon\u2019s damage die twice, taking the best result. If you have any bonus damage dice, such as +d12, for attacking an unaware opponent, bonus dice are not rolled twice. Bonus damage dice rolls are only ever rolled once and not modified by advantage. Morale When you\u2019re fighting more than one opponent, the opponents must pass a WIL check as a group to keep fighting after they take their first casualty and again after they lose half their numbers or their leader is defeated. Lone foes must pass a WIL check when reduced to 0 HP. Morale checks don\u2019t apply to players. You have to decide when it\u2019s prudent to run away! Disengaging If you want to retreat to an adjacent zone while an enemy occupies your zone, you must first make a successful STR or DEX check to disengage from the fight. If you fail, the enemy makes a free attack as you move out of the zone. An attribute check is not required if you have allies in the zone that haven\u2019t yet taken action. Hit Points and Damage Damage is first dealt to your Hit Points (HP). HP represents your ability to avoid or shrug off any harm. When HP is depleted, the damage is dealt to your STR attribute. Damage to the STR attribute is potentially grievous harm. After taking STR damage, you must make a STR check. If the check succeeds, you\u2019re still in action and can continue fighting. If you fail, you take critical damage . Critical Damage When you suffer critical damage, you are knocked unconscious and take an Injured burden. You remain unconscious until revived by an ally. Even after you\u2019re revived, the Injured burden remains until it\u2019s cleared. If you\u2019re left unconscious for an hour, your character dies. Attribute Score Loss and Death If your STR is reduced to zero, your character is dead. If your DEX is reduced to zero, you\u2019re paralyzed. If your WIL is reduced to zero, you fall into a stupor. All your dice rolls are disadvantaged if your LUCK is reduced to zero. If your character dies, create a new one. The GM will introduce them as quickly as possible. Rest and healing There are three ways for your character to rest and recover: Short Rest : Resting for a complete turn restores all lost HP but may expose the party. Long Rest : Resting for a watch uninterrupted restores one lost point of STR, DEX, and WIL and removes all Dazed and Fatigued burdens. Full Rest : Resting in a safe location for a week restores all lost STR, DEX, and WIL and removes all Injured or other long-term burdens. Magical healing or the care of skilled healers may shorten these recovery times. Advancement Your character earns Experience Points (XP) by bringing treasure and valuable relics back from their adventures to the safety of a settlement. For every coin\u2019s worth of treasure brought back (divided equally amongst the party), your character earns 1 XP. Your character can earn additional XP by spending their coins selflessly on improvements to a settlement. For every 10 coins spent this way, your character earns 1 XP. Level Characters start at level 1. The following table shows the total XP required to advance each level. Level HP Stamina XP 1 d4+2 0 0 2 2d6 1 1000 3 3d6 2 3000 4 3d6 2 6000 5+ 3d6 3 +5000 When your character earns enough XP to advance to the next level, perform the following actions: Roll for attribute increase : Roll 3d6 for each attribute: STR, DEX, WIL, and LUCK. If the result exceeds the maximum value that your character has for the attribute, increase it by one. If none of your attributes are increased, increase the lowest attribute by 1. Roll hit points : Roll the dice listed for the new level\u2019s HP. If the result exceeds the maximum HP that your character has, replace it with the rolled value. Otherwise, increase your HP by 1. The highest value that a character can attain for attributes and HP is 18. Stamina Starting at level 2, your character gains the Stamina attribute. Stamina allows your character to ignore burdens. For each point of Stamina, you may place one burden into the Stamina space on your character sheet rather than in your inventory. After it\u2019s put into the Stamina space, a burden is ignored but can\u2019t be removed until cleared. Spells Spells are living, sentient spirits bound within rune-etched obsidian or lead tablets. Spells are rare and found in forgotten places, such as dungeons, ancient tombs, and dragon hoards. The capture and binding of spells is an art lost to all but the most learned wizards, who guard their secrets jealously. A spell tablet has three units of arcane energy or essence used to power the spell it contains. Essence is volatile and can be depleted from the tablet by casting its spell. The more essence you harness when casting a spell, the greater its magnitude and effect, but the greater the risk of depleting the essence. Once all essence is exhausted from a tablet, the spell can no longer be cast. Casting a Spell To cast a spell, your character must hold the tablet and recite the inscribed incantations aloud. Declare how much essence you\u2019ll use when casting the spell, up to the maximum number remaining in the tablet. Roll as many d6 equal to the declared amount of essence. Deplete one essence in the tablet for each 5 or 6 rolled. The spell produces an effect that varies depending on the number of dice rolled and the sum of the dice. See the following \u201cSpell List\u201d for the effects. Recharging a Spell Once all the essence in a tablet is depleted, its spell can no longer be cast. Each tablet, however, has a recharge condition. Fulfilling this condition rekindles the spirit within the tablet and restores three essence. Miscasting a Spell Whenever one or more 6s are rolled when casting a spell, the spell parasitically drains the caster\u2019s focus and mental energies. For each 6, the caster takes d6 damage to WIL and then makes a WIL check. If failed, the caster takes a Dazed burden. The spell still materializes, though at a cost to the caster. Selling a Spell A fully charged spell tablet can usually be sold for 2d6 x 100 coins in a large settlement. A depleted tablet is, at most, a fourth of its value. Spell List In the following Effect descriptions: [DICE] is the number of dice rolled equal to the essence used to cast the spell. [SUM] is the sum of the rolled dice. For example, the Darkness spell creates a [SUM] x 2-foot diameter sphere of pure darkness for [DICE] turns. If two essence are used to cast Darkness, and the result of the 2d6 roll is 7, the spell creates a sphere 14 feet wide for 2 turns. Spells extract d66 Spell Name Effect Recharge 11 Animal Form The target of the spell and their possessions are transformed into a beast of your choice for [SUM] turns or until they take critical damage.

Alternate Initiative System Attribution : Adapted from Errant written by Ava Islam and published by Kill Jester Publishing, LLP . Licensed under a CC-BY-4.0 license. Declaring Actions At the beginning of a round, the GM describes the actions likely taken by your opponents. You then declare your character\u2019s intentions for the round before rolling any dice. Determining Quick and Slow Turns Next, all combatants determine whether their declared intentions involve a quick or slow turn. A quick turn consists of taking only a single action , such as: Using a relic Casting a spell Making an attack Moving to an adjacent zone Disengaging from an opponent Trying a gambit against a close opponent A slow turn consists of both moving and taking an action , or actions that take more time, such as: Moving twice Aiming a ranged weapon Reviving an incapacitated ally Moving before making an attack Concentrating on maintaining an ongoing spell Retrieving a weapon from a backpack, then attacking Setting Turn Order and Resolving Actions After determining who\u2019s turns will be quick or slow, the order of resolving actions is as follows: Resolve all quick turns before slow turns. If players and opponents both take a quick turn, the player must make a DEX or WIL check to go first. If players and opponents both take a slow turn, the player must make a DEX or WIL check to go first.","title":"Appendix"},{"location":"4%20Appendix/#appendix","text":"This appendix contains the following sections: core rules summary starting gear for standard fantasy archetypes alternate tactical initiative rules","title":"Appendix"},{"location":"4%20Appendix/#1-tyros-rpg-rules-summary","text":"","title":"1.
