                <h1 id="how-to-play">How to Play</h1>
<p>The core of this game is a conversation between the players and the game master (GM). The GM describes the players’ current situation. Then the players ask questions and tell the GM what their characters do. The GM explains the results of their actions, and then the players react again and describe more activities, and so on.</p>
<p>The GM answers your questions and always respects your freedom of choice. The GM provides challenges, obstacles, and situations to solve and overcome. Still, the game is more than just a story narrated by the GM—it’s an interactive fiction built on your and your fellow players’ decisions. Consider it as both creating and acting in an adventure story simultaneously.</p>
<p>Suppose the outcome of your character’s actions is not immediately apparent, or the activity is inherently risky. In that case, the GM might ask you to roll dice to determine the results.</p>
<h2 id="attribute-checks">Attribute Checks</h2>
<p>When you describe your character doing something risky, or the outcome is uncertain, the GM may ask you to make an <strong>attribute check</strong>.</p>
<p>Roll a <strong>d20</strong> and compare the result to the applicable attribute score. If the result is less than or equal to the relevant attribute score, your character succeeds and suffers no consequences. If the result exceeds the score, your character fails and suffers the outcome described by the GM.</p>
<h2 id="using-attributes">Using Attributes</h2>
<p>Your character is a determined, resourceful adventurer, capable of trying almost anything. So when the outcome is risky, and the GM calls for an attribute check, how do we determine which attribute to roll against?</p>
<p>Your description of the action determines the applicable attribute. Consider a locked castle door—how do you pass through it? If you break out a crowbar and try to force it open, that’s a STR check. If you use a lock pick to unlock the door, that’s a DEX check. If you want to bribe a guard to open it, that’s a WIL check.</p>
<p>Don’t think about what your character is capable of, but <em>how</em> they would approach a problem. Play to all of your character’s assets.</p>
<h2 id="critical-successes-and-failures">Critical Successes and Failures</h2>
<p>Rolling the <strong>exact attribute score</strong> on a check is a critical success, and the outcome will be better than expected. Increase your LUCK attribute score by 1.</p>
<p>Conversely, rolling a <strong>20</strong> is a critical failure, and the outcome will be worse than expected. Decrease your LUCK by 1.</p>
<h2 id="advantage-and-disadvantage">Advantage and Disadvantage</h2>
<p>If you roll a check and are particularly well prepared or equipped, the GM may allow you to roll with an advantage. Roll <strong>two d20s</strong> and take the <strong>best</strong> result.</p>
<p>If you are in a dire position or ill-prepared for your task, the GM may ask you to roll with a disadvantage. Roll <strong>two d20s</strong> and take the <strong>worst</strong> result.</p>
<h2 id="luck">Luck</h2>
<p>Luck applies only to player characters, not hirelings, monsters, or any other non-player characters controlled by the GM.</p>
<p>You can decrease (burn) your LUCK to change the dice rolls for an attribute check. Add or remove the amount of LUCK you want to burn from the result. Be warned: running out of LUCK (the score becoming zero) will cause all your dice rolls to have a disadvantage and possibly other detrimental effects. LUCK can’t be less than zero.</p>
<p>The GM may sometimes call for a LUCK check if an outcome is random and your other attributes don’t apply.</p>
<h2 id="time">Time</h2>
<p>The game measures time in three durations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Round</strong> is the time scale for combat. Each round is around 10 seconds.</li>
<li><strong>Turn</strong> is the time scale for exploration. Each turn is around 10 minutes, enough time to explore a room and perform an Action or two.</li>
<li><strong>Watch</strong> is the time scale used when traveling. Each Watch is 6 hours: morning, afternoon, evening, and night. A party can travel 6 miles in 1 watch in open terrain and clear weather.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="distances-and-zones">Distances and Zones</h2>
<p>The game uses zones as abstractions of distance and area to divide larger physical spaces into smaller units, like rooms in a house.</p>
<p>For example, at the start of combat, the GM divides the battlefield into at least three zones; one where the party starts, one where the enemies start, and the area between them.</p>
<p>The distance within and between zones is relative:</p>
<p><strong>Close</strong>: Within the same zone.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can touch it.</li>
<li>Most actions affect things in your zone.</li>
<li>You can speak softly and be heard.</li>
<li>In range of <em>melee</em> weapons. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Near</strong>: One zone away.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can get to it. </li>
<li>You can speak and be heard.</li>
<li>In range of <em>thrown</em> weapons.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Far</strong>: Two zones away.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can shoot at it.</li>
<li>You can shout and be heard.</li>
<li>In range for <em>short-range</em> weapons.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Distant</strong>: Three zones away.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can see it.</li>
<li>Too far away for verbal communication.</li>
<li>In range for <em>long-range</em> weapons.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>Combat is dangerous, and wise adventurers seek to avoid it. Still, sometimes conflict is inevitable. </p>
<h3 id="initiative">Initiative</h3>
<p>If you attack unsuspecting foes, your character and any allies aware of the plan go first. Otherwise, make a DEX <em>or</em> WIL check to act before your opponents. In following combat rounds, maintain this order.</p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p>On your turn in a combat round, your character can move to an adjacent zone and take an action. Actions can range from attacking, moving again, tripping or disarming an opponent, negotiating, or anything else within reason.</p>
<h3 id="attacks">Attacks</h3>
<p><strong>Attacks always hit</strong>. Roll your weapon’s damage die or dice (refer to the weapons list) and do that much damage to an opponent minus their armor. Remember, this is also true for your opponents; their attacks always hit you.</p>
<h3 id="bonus-damage">Bonus Damage</h3>
<p>In some situations, attacks may receive an extra die, noted as +d6, +d8, etc. Roll the extra die with your weapon’s damage roll, keeping the <strong>best</strong> result. For example, attacks against helpless or unaware targets receive <strong>+d12</strong> bonus damage.</p>
<h3 id="impaired-attacks">Impaired Attacks</h3>
<p>When an attack is impaired, such as firing into cover or fighting while your hands are bound, roll the <strong>+d4</strong> damage and use the <strong>worst</strong> result.</p>
<h3 id="critical-hits">Critical Hits</h3>
<p>Rolling the <strong>maximum damage</strong> on a weapon’s die roll is a critical hit. A critical hit <strong>ignores</strong> the target’s armor and deals the total damage.</p>
<h3 id="dual-wielding">Dual-Wielding</h3>
<p>If attacking with two weapons, one in your main hand and one offhand, roll damage for both and choose the best result.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-attackers">Multiple Attackers</h3>
<p>If multiple combatants attack the same target, all attackers roll their damage but keep only the best result. </p>
<h3 id="ranged-attacks">Ranged Attacks</h3>
<p>Ranged weapons can’t be used if you’re in the same zone as your target.</p>
<h3 id="aiming">Aiming</h3>
<p>Not moving and using an action to aim instead of attacking allows a character to ignore the target’s armor with a ranged weapon the next round.</p>
<h3 id="blast">Blast</h3>
<p>Attacks with the <em>blast</em> quality affect all targets in the zone, rolling damage separately for each affected combatant. Blast refers to anything from fireballs, massive cleaving onslaughts, and a swarm of tiny creatures. If unsure how many targets can be affected in the zone, roll the weapon’s damage die for the number.</p>
<h3 id="subdual">Subdual</h3>
<p>Rather than inflicting grievous harm, you can attempt to <strong>subdue</strong> an opponent using a melee weapon. Ranged weapons can’t subdue. Declare that you’re trying to subdue and then attack as usual but halve the damage. An opponent who would suffer critical damage or death from a subdual attack is instead knocked unconscious.</p>
<h3 id="gambits">Gambits</h3>
<p>Gambits are combat maneuvers such as stunning, shoving, disarming, tripping, or sundering armor. They’re resolved with a check by the combatant most at risk. Gambits can’t cause damage directly but may do so indirectly (for example, pushing an enemy off a ledge). </p>
<h3 id="advantage-in-combat">Advantage in Combat</h3>
<p>Characters can gain an advantage in combat by attacking a target on lower ground, off balance, disarmed, distracted, or tactically disadvantaged in any significant way. </p>
<p>When a character has an advantage against an opponent on their combat turn, they can apply advantage to either their damage roll or a gambit against that opponent. Alternatively, you can make an attack and a gambit attempt against that opponent without an advantage in the same round.</p>
<p>If you apply advantage to your damage roll, roll only your weapon’s damage die twice, taking the best result. If you have any bonus damage dice, such as +d12, for attacking an unaware opponent, bonus dice are not rolled twice. Bonus damage dice rolls are only ever rolled once and not modified by advantage.</p>
<h3 id="morale">Morale</h3>
<p>When you’re fighting more than one opponent, the opponents must pass a WIL check as a group to keep fighting after they take their first casualty and again after they lose half their numbers or their leader is defeated.</p>
<p>Lone foes must pass a WIL check when reduced to 0 HP.</p>
<p>Morale checks don’t apply to players. You have to decide when it’s prudent to run away!</p>
<h3 id="disengaging">Disengaging</h3>
<p>If you want to retreat to an adjacent zone while an enemy occupies your zone, you must first make a successful STR <em>or</em> DEX check to disengage from the fight. If you fail, the enemy makes a free attack as you move out of the zone.</p>
<p>An attribute check is not required if you have allies in the zone that haven’t yet taken action.</p>
<h2 id="hit-points-and-damage">Hit Points and Damage</h2>
<p>Damage is first dealt to your Hit Points (HP). HP represents your ability to avoid or shrug off any harm.</p>
<p>When HP is depleted, the damage is dealt to your STR attribute. Damage to the STR attribute is potentially grievous harm.</p>
<p>After taking STR damage, you must make a STR check. If the check succeeds, you’re still in action and can continue fighting. If you fail, you take <strong>critical damage</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="critical-damage">Critical Damage</h2>
<p>When you suffer critical damage, you are knocked unconscious and take an <em>Injured</em> burden. You remain unconscious until revived by an ally. Even after you’re revived, the <em>Injured</em> burden remains until it’s cleared.</p>
<p>If you’re left unconscious for an hour, your character dies.</p>
<h2 id="attribute-score-loss-and-death">Attribute Score Loss and Death</h2>
<p>If your STR is reduced to zero, your character is dead. If your DEX is reduced to zero, you’re paralyzed. If your WIL is reduced to zero, you fall into a stupor. All your dice rolls are disadvantaged if your LUCK is reduced to zero.</p>
<p>If your character dies, create a new one. The GM will introduce them as quickly as possible. </p>
<h2 id="rest-and-healing">Rest and healing</h2>
<p>There are three ways for your character to rest and recover:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Short Rest</strong>: Resting for a complete turn restores all lost HP but may expose the party.</li>
<li><strong>Long Rest</strong>: Resting for a watch uninterrupted restores one lost point of STR, DEX, and WIL and removes all <em>Dazed</em> and <em>Fatigued</em> burdens.</li>
<li><strong>Full Rest</strong>: Resting in a safe location for a week restores all lost STR, DEX, and WIL and removes all <em>Injured</em> or other long-term burdens.</li>
</ul>
<p>Magical healing or the care of skilled healers may shorten these recovery times.</p>
<h2 id="advancement">Advancement</h2>
<p>Your character earns Experience Points (XP) by bringing treasure and valuable relics back from their adventures to the safety of a settlement.</p>
<p>For every coin’s worth of treasure brought back (divided equally amongst the party), your character earns 1 XP.</p>
<p>Your character can earn additional XP by spending their coins selflessly on improvements to a settlement. For every 10 coins spent this way, your character earns 1 XP.</p>
<h3 id="level">Level</h3>
<p>Characters start at level 1.</p>
<p>The following table shows the total XP required to advance each level.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="center">Level</th>

</table>
<p>When your character earns enough XP to advance to the next level, perform the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Roll for attribute increase</strong>: Roll 3d6 for each attribute: STR, DEX, WIL, and LUCK. If the result exceeds the maximum value that your character has for the attribute, increase it by one. If none of your attributes are increased, increase the lowest attribute by 1.</li>
<li><strong>Roll hit points</strong>: Roll the dice listed for the new level’s HP. If the result exceeds the maximum HP that your character has, replace it with the rolled value. Otherwise, increase your HP by 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>The highest value that a character can attain for attributes and HP is 18.</p>
<h3 id="stamina">Stamina</h3>
<p>Starting at level 2, your character gains the <strong>Stamina</strong> attribute. Stamina allows your character to ignore burdens.</p>
<p>For each point of Stamina, you may place one burden into the Stamina space on your character sheet rather than in your inventory. After it’s put into the Stamina space, a burden is ignored but can’t be removed until cleared.</p>
<h2 id="spells">Spells</h2>
<p>Spells are living, sentient spirits bound within rune-etched obsidian or lead tablets. Spells are rare and found in forgotten places, such as dungeons, ancient tombs, and dragon hoards. The capture and binding of spells is an art lost to all but the most learned wizards, who guard their secrets jealously.</p>
<p>A spell tablet has three units of arcane energy or essence used to power the spell it contains. Essence is volatile and can be depleted from the tablet by casting its spell. The more essence you harness when casting a spell, the greater its magnitude and effect, but the greater the risk of depleting the essence. Once all essence is exhausted from a tablet, the spell can no longer be cast.</p>
<h3 id="casting-a-spell">Casting a Spell</h3>
<p>To cast a spell, your character must hold the tablet and recite the inscribed incantations aloud.</p>
<p>Declare how much essence you’ll use when casting the spell, up to the maximum number remaining in the tablet.</p>
<p>Roll as many <strong>d6</strong> equal to the declared amount of essence. Deplete one essence in the tablet for each <strong>5 or 6</strong> rolled. </p>
<p>The spell produces an effect that varies depending on the number of dice rolled and the sum of the dice. See the following “Spell List” for the effects.</p>
<h3 id="recharging-a-spell">Recharging a Spell</h3>
<p>Once all the essence in a tablet is depleted, its spell can no longer be cast. Each tablet, however, has a recharge condition. Fulfilling this condition rekindles the spirit within the tablet and restores three essence. </p>
<h3 id="miscasting-a-spell">Miscasting a Spell</h3>
<p>Whenever one or more <strong>6s</strong> are rolled when casting a spell, the spell parasitically drains the caster’s focus and mental energies. For each 6, the caster takes <strong>d6</strong> damage to WIL and then makes a WIL check. If failed, the caster takes a <em>Dazed</em> burden.</p>
<p>The spell still materializes, though at a cost to the caster.</p>
<h3 id="selling-a-spell">Selling a Spell</h3>
<p>A fully charged spell tablet can usually be sold for 2d6 x 100 coins in a large settlement. A depleted tablet is, at most, a fourth of its value.</p>
<h3 id="spell-list">Spell List</h3>
<p>In the following Effect descriptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>[DICE] is the number of dice rolled equal to the essence used to cast the spell.</li>
<li>[SUM] is the sum of the rolled dice.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the Darkness spell creates a [SUM] x 2-foot diameter sphere of pure darkness for [DICE] turns.</p>
<p>If two essence are used to cast Darkness, and the result of the 2d6 roll is 7, the spell creates a sphere 14 feet wide for 2 turns.</p>
