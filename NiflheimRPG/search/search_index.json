Brawn : endurance, strength, toughness Finesse : agility, charm, speed Intellect : intelligence, perception, willpower For each Ability, in order, roll 3d6 . If you like, you can then swap any two Ability scores. 3: Hit Protection Hit Protection (HP) measures your character's capability to avoid severe damage. HP is quickly replenished. Damage first reduces your HP. After your HP is zero, damage reduces your Brawn. Damage to Brawn represents a more severe injury. Roll 1d6 for your character's HP. 4: Starting Class Your character's class determines their starting equipment. In turn, the equipment carried decides your character's role and skills. Each class has an associated talisman that enables class-specific skills. If you meet the minimum Ability score requirement, change your class by equipping up a new talisman. You can only carry one talisman at a time. Warrior You might have been a soldier, a guardsman, a shieldmaiden, or a raider in another life. Your shield was always strapped to your arm and your axe and spear at hand. You sang the songs of battle and drank to victory and defeat in smoke-filled mead halls. In combat, you favoured the direct approach, relying on your sturdy armour to deflect any blows while giving you time to land your own. In the time before, you prayed to \u00d3\u00f0inn for a glorious death. Now your fate is your own to choose. WARRIOR (Brawn) Linden wood shield Warrior talisman, +1 Armour Chain mail bulky, 2 Armour Bearded axe 1d8 damage Ashwood spear 1d6 damage, range 20' Empty inventory slots 5 Skills: BLOCK (reaction, shield, fatigue) Raise your shield to block damage from an attack. Make a Brawn save: - Success : Block all damage from the attack. - Failure : Your opponent's damage roll has disadvantage . PARRY (reaction, shield) Deflect attack and riposte; Brawn save to avoid all physical damage and retaliate with damage advantage ; failure results in the attack against you gaining damage advantage . DISARM (axe, fatigue) Hook your opponent's weapon hand; your opponent needs to make a Finesse save or be disarmed. HACK (axe, fatigue) Attack your opponent in a frenzy for double damage - On a Critical Hit , your opponent must make a Brawn save or stagger backwards from the ferocity of the attack losing their next turn. THRUST (spear, fatigue) Lunge forward to extend the range of your weapon and strike targets up to 10 feet away. Scout You might have been a hunter, an archer, a scoundrel, or an explorer in another life. With a pair of sharp knives and a trusty shortbow, you easily made your way in the world, whether in the untamed wilderness or cut-throat civilisation. You found the paths and trails no one else could, weaving your way through danger and adventure at every turn. Your fast reflexes helped save you in situations where your quick tongue could not. In combat, you either slipped in close, unnoticed or struck silently from afar with unerring accuracy. Even in the time before, you forged your own path. Now that your fate is unwritten, the Nine Realms are yours for the taking.

LACERATE (hunting knives, fatigue) Roll your initial damage and then roll 1d4 for both bleed damage and duration on subsequent rounds. VOLLEY (bow, fatigue) Loose two arrows without hesitation; roll your damage twice. - On a Critical Hit , loose another arrow and roll another damage die. Seer You might have been a wise woman, an augur, a trickster, or a conjurer in another life. The only things you needed were your wits and a hunger for knowledge. You sought to delve into the mysteries of the realms and pluck forth the secrets within. You stayed in the shadows, called on for your counsel and power. Mistrusted by some, feared by others, and respected by all. You were never much for combat, preferring to work your cunning to rain destruction or mischief on your foes from a safe distance. The gods are dead, but their secrets are still waiting under ash and weald. You've seen your future, and it's filled with endless possibilities.

Make an Intellect save: - Success : Negate all damage from the attack. - Failure : Your opponent's damage roll has disadvantage .

The GM describes the players' current situation. The players then ask questions and tell what their characters do. The GM explains the results of the players' actions; the players react and describe more activities, and so on. Suppose the outcome of your character's actions is not immediately apparent, or the activity is risky. In that case, the GM may ask that you roll dice to determine the results. The GM will answer your questions and always respect your freedom of choice. The GM will certainly provide challenges, obstacles, and situations to solve and overcome. Still, the game is not a story narrated by the GM. Instead, it's an interactive fiction built upon your and your fellow players' decisions. Actions and Ability Saves Actions are anything your character does when interacting with the world, whether it's haggling with an innkeeper, avoiding a trap, crossing swords with a villain, or invoking the powers of an elder god. Your description of what your character is doing determines the outcome of their Actions. Your character's Actions always succeed as you describe unless there's potential for risk or consequence to the narrative. Ability Saves When your character's Action is risky or could change the narrative, your GM may call for an Ability Save . Your GM tells you what Ability is relevant, and you then roll d20 . If the result is less than or equal to your character's Ability score, the Action succeeds . Otherwise, it fails . Regardless of Ability scores, a roll of 1 always succeeds, while a 20 always fails. Advantage and Disadvantage Suppose careful preparation reduces the risk of an Action or other situational factors. In that case, your GM may grant an Advantage on your Ability Save. If so, you roll an extra d20 and take the lowest single result. If an Action has multiple advantages, it may no longer be considered risky and might not require an Ability Save. Conversely, suppose the Action is made riskier by great haste, lack of appropriate gear, or other factors. In that case, your GM may require a Disadvantage on your Ability Save. If so, you roll an extra d20 and take the highest single result. Ability Saves with both Advantages and Disadvantages are rolled as usual with one d20. Time and Distance Time and distance are abstracted and flexible, depending on the current narrative. Time The game measures time in three durations: Round, Turn, and Watch. Round is the time scale for combat. Each Round is less than a minute. Turn is the time scale for exploration. Each Turn is around 10 minutes, enough time to explore a room and perform an Action or two. Watch is the time scale used when travelling. Each Watch is about 6 hours. Distance The game measures distance with four zones or bands: Close, Near, Far, and Distant. Your character can move between adjacent zones in one Round. Close means that the opponents are within striking distance of hand-held melee weapons. Near means that the opponents are out of striking distance for melee weapons but within range of thrown weapons, ranged weapons, and spells. Far means the opponents are even further apart, out of range for melee and thrown weapons, but within range of ranged weapons or spells. Distant means the opponents are entirely out of reach of any weapon or magic.","title":"Playing the Game"},{"location":"2-Playing%20the%20Game/#playing-the-game","text":"The core of this game is a conversation between players and GM.

At the beginning of each round, you declare what your character is doing before rolling dice. The GM will indicate the likely actions that your opponents will take. Initiative Actions are considered to coincide, or if the order of actions is unclear, the GM may require a Finesse save to act before an opponent. Attacking Attacks always hit. You simply roll your weapon's damage die and deal that much damage to your opponent's HP. Armour Before dealing damage to HP, subtract the target's Armour rating from the result of your damage roll. Some types of damage, such as falling or burning, ignore armour entirely. Advantage and Disadvantage In some situations that make an attack more or less deadly, the GM may decide that your character's damage has Advantage or Disadvantage . In this case, roll an extra damage die and take the best or worst result, respectively. Reactions Your character can react to an enemy's attack and attempt to either block or avoid damage. Some reactions are available only to specific equipment, such as shields or magic spells. All reactions usually require an associated Ability save and add one Fatigue to inventory. All characters have two reactions regardless of equipment: Dodge and Retreat . 1: DODGE (fatigue, Finesse) Attempt to avoid an attack by quickly ducking or rolling away. Add one Fatigue and make a Finesse save. - Success : Avoid all damage . Failure : Your opponent's damage roll has disadvantage . 2: RETREAT (fatigue, Finesse) Disengage and retreat from combat. Add one Fatigue and make a Finesse save. - Success : Retreat without suffering damage. - Failure : You escape but still take damage from the attack. Critical Hits Some weapons have special abilities triggered when rolling maximum damage, such as rolling a ten on 1d10. Multiple Attacks If multiple allies in the same zone attack the same opponent, roll each damage separately, but deal the single highest result. Dual Weapons If your character wields two weapons, roll damage for each, but deal the single highest result. Blast Attacks with a blast quality affect all nearby targets in a zone, rolling damage separately. Blast refers to anything from explosions to massive cleaving onslaughts to the impact of siege engine projectiles.

After HP is zero, damage then reduces your Brawn Ability. Losing HP represents general wear and tear that's quickly restored and not life-threatening. Damage to Brawn means more grievous harm. Ability Loss After taking damage to Brawn, roll a Brawn Save. If your Save fails, the damage is a Critical Injury . Your character adds a Fatigue debility to their inventory and is unconscious and out of the fight until revived. Some creatures, poisons, diseases, or spells can potentially damage your character's other Abilities. Damage to any Ability score is potentially grave. If Brawn is reduced to zero, your character dies. It's time to roll a new character. If Finesse is reduced to zero, your character can no longer make use of their limbs. If Intellect is reduced to zero, your character is stricken with madness. The GM might determine their actions until the character's Intellect is restored. Scars When damage to your character reduces their HP to exactly zero, they are sometimes changed irrevocably. See the Scars table for details. Deprivation and Fatigue A character deprived of a crucial need (such as food or rest) cannot heal HP or Ability scores. Anyone deprived for more than a day adds Fatigue to their inventory, one for each day. Each Fatigue occupies one slot and lasts until they recuperate (such as a whole night's rest in a safe spot). Characters can also gain Fatigue by: casting spells suffering critical injuries through events in the narrative Healing Resting for a few moments after an encounter restores all lost HP. Ability loss and other serious ailments are more difficult to heal. You can generally recover lost Ability points with a week or two of rest under a healer's care or other sources of appropriate expertise. Some of these services are free, while magical or more expedient means of recovery may come at a cost.

Bonfires Bonfires link the Nine Realms and offer a beacon of hope to souls lost in the dark. Resting at a bonfire restores all lost HP, clears all Fatigue from your inventory, and resets Ability score loss. Death Prepare to die often. After you die, you wake up at the bonfire where you last rested. You retain all your equipment, and your health is fully restored.
