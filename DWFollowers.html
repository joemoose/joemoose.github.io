<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>This document covers the creation, recruitment, and usage of Followers.</p>

<p>Only the penniless and foolhardy undertake an expedition without proper support in the form of porters, hunters, guides, and guards, not to mention specialists who can bring their skills to bear in any number of ways. Followers are those individuals (people, beasts, or monsters) who offer such assistance, accompanying the party on their exploits about the world.</p>

<p>In general, the players can tell the GM what they want their Followers to do and expect then to do it.</p>

<p>Like monsters, Followers have HP, armor, damage, and instincts. They usually have moves and tags that indicate what they’re good at and how they act.</p>

<p>Followers can deal and take damage. When they would deal damage, you roll their damage die. When they take damage, they lose HP. If reduced to 0 HP, they are out of the action and probably dead or dying—their fate is in the GM’s hands.</p>

<p>Unlike monsters, Followers have three additional statistics: <strong>Quality</strong>, <strong>Loyalty</strong>, and <strong>Cost</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="quality">Quality</h3>

<p>Quality represents how effective the Follower is, particularly in the areas defined by their tags and moves. A Follower’s Quality can range from -1 (rubbish) to +3 (masterful). A Follower of average competence has a Quality of 0.</p>

<h3 id="loyalty">Loyalty</h3>

<p>Loyalty tracks how committed the Follower is to you and your cause. It usually starts at +1 but often changes often, ranging from -2 to +3. When a Follower’s Loyalty drops to -3, they betray or abandon you. Note that Loyalty is a resource to be used up by the GM like any other.</p>

<h3 id="cost">Cost</h3>

<p>Cost describes what motivates the Follower to follow. Although a strong leader or worthy cause can be motivating factors, all but the most selfless Followers do the dirty work in exchange for coin or other material rewards. A Follower’s Loyalty increases when you pay their Cost. Costs aren’t always tangible things.</p>

<h2 id="follower-moves">Follower Moves</h2>

<p>Followers can make the Encumbrance, Make Camp, and Recover moves and make the Last Breath move at the GM&#8217;s discretion. Unless otherwise noted, they don’t make any of the basic moves. Instead, use the following moves.</p>

<h3 id="recruit">Recruit</h3>

<p>When you <strong>go looking to hire help</strong>, tell the GM what you’re offering and whom you’re looking for, phrased in one of the following ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>A group of ____ (porters, guards, minstrels, angry farmers, etc.)</li>
<li>A skilled ____ (guide, sage, burglar, bodyguard, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>A group is a Follower like any other, but with the <em>Group</em> tag. A Group functions as a single unit but comprises a small number of individuals, 3–6 or so.</p>

<p>If the GM says that you can’t find that kind of help in a place like this, start over or move on.</p>

<p>Otherwise, roll +nothing, but with <strong>advantage</strong> if you have a good reputation in these parts:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>10+</strong>, they’re yours for the hiring.</li>
<li><strong>7&#8211;9</strong>, the GM chooses one from the list below.</li>
<li><strong>6-</strong>, no one shows, but mark XP.

<ul>
<li>They demand more generous compensation, in coin or some other form.</li>
<li>No one here fits the bill, but you hear of someone elsewhere who does.</li>
<li>They have a need that must be met first (permission from someone else, a favor, etc.)</li>
<li>You can tell that they are less than ideal (ask the GM how).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The GM will choose or roll their specifics (Quality, Loyalty, Instinct, Cost, tags, etc.) as needed, discovered through play—which might involve you grilling them, right now.</p>

<h3 id="order-follower">Order Follower</h3>

<p>When you <strong>order or expect a Follower to do something dangerous, degrading, or contrary to their Instinct</strong>, roll +Loyalty:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>10+</strong>, they do it, now.</li>
<li><strong>7&#8211;9</strong>, they do it, the GM picks one from the list below.</li>
<li><strong>6-</strong>, mark XP, and the GM makes a move.

<ul>
<li>Decrease the Follower’s Loyalty by 1.</li>
<li>They complain loudly, now or later, and demand something in return.</li>
<li>Caution, laziness, or fear makes them take a long time to get it done.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="do-their-thing">Do Their Thing</h3>

<p>When a Follower <strong>does something chancy within the scope of their tags or moves</strong>, roll +Quality:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>10+</strong>, they do it, as well as one could reasonably hope.</li>
<li><strong>7&#8211;9</strong>, they do it, but there’s an unforeseen cost, consequence, or limitation (ask the GM what).</li>
<li><strong>6-</strong>, mark XP, and GM makes a move.</li>
</ul>

<p>When a Follower <strong>does something chancy that falls beyond the scope of their tags or moves</strong> or does anything on their own, the GM will tell you what happens.</p>

<h3 id="call-for-assistance">Call for Assistance</h3>

<p>When a Follower <strong>helps you make a move that calls for a roll</strong>, gain advantage on that roll, but the Followers share any potential consequences.</p>

<p>When a Follower <strong>helps you Hack and Slash or Volley</strong>, roll their damage die alongside your own, use the highest one, and add any damage bonuses you get on top of that.</p>

<p>When a Follower <strong>helps you Defend</strong>, you can spend one hold to redirect an attack to them instead of yourself.</p>

<h3 id="pay-up">Pay Up</h3>

<p>When you <strong>pay a Follower’s cost</strong>, increase their Loyalty by 1 (to a maximum of +3). You can’t trigger this move again until both you and your Followers have Made Camp.</p>

<h3 id="watch-them-go">Watch Them Go</h3>

<p>When a Follower has -3 Loyalty, they betray or abandon you at the next opportunity.</p>

<h3 id="example-do-your-fang">Example, Do Your Fang!</h3>

<p>The party gets jumped by a gang of forest goblins. The Ranger tells her cougar, Fang (Stealthy, Quality +1, d8 damage), to Do Her Thing by sending the animal into the brush to bring down the forest goblin shaman.</p>

<p>She rolls a 9, +1 for Fang’s Quality, for a 10+ result: the cougar does it, “as well as one could reasonably hope.” But the GM knows the spellcaster has 12 HP and is a slippery bugger so that Fang won’t be killing him. Instead, the GM asks the Ranger to roll Fang’s d8 damage and narrates the spells relenting as the shaman flees into the woods.</p>

<h2 id="follower-tags">Follower Tags</h2>
