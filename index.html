<h2 id="basic-moves">Basic Moves</h2>

<p>The following moves are available to all character classes of any level.</p>

<h3 id="advantage-disadvantage">Advantage &amp; Disadvantage</h3>

<p>When you <strong>roll with Advantage</strong>, roll an extra die and discard the lowest result.</p>

<p>When you <strong>roll with Disadvantage</strong>, roll an extra die and discard the highest result.</p>

<h3 id="aid">Aid</h3>

<p>When you <strong>help another player character (PC) before they roll their move</strong>, either they can accomplish more than they could have alone, or you grant them <em>Advantage</em> on their roll.</p>

<p>By aiding, you are exposed to any risk, cost, or consequence associated with their roll.</p>

<h3 id="defy-danger">Defy Danger</h3>

<p>When <strong>the stakes are high, danger looms, and you act anyway</strong>, roll with the relevant modifier:</p>

<ul>
<li>+STR to use sheer might</li>
<li>+DEX to use speed, agility, or finesse</li>
<li>+CON to resist or endure</li>
<li>+INT to think fast, focus, or remember</li>
<li>+WIS to use intuition or willpower</li>
<li>+CHA to charm, bluff, or impress</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>On a 10+</strong>, you pull it off as well as one could hope. <strong>On a 7&#8211;9</strong>, you can do it, but the GM will present a lesser success, a cost, or a consequence (and maybe a choice between them, or a chance to back down).</p>

<h3 id="discern-reality">Discern Reality</h3>

<p>When you <strong>closely study a situation or person</strong>, you can ask the GM one of the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What happened here recently?</li>
<li>What is about to happen?</li>
<li>What (else) should I be on the lookout for?</li>
<li>What here is (most) useful or valuable to me?</li>
<li>Who or what is really in control here?</li>
<li>What here is not what it appears to be?</li>
</ul>

<p>If the answer is obvious, the <strong>GM answers honestly</strong>. If <strong>the answer isn’t obvious</strong>, roll +WIS. <strong>On a 7+</strong>, the GM answers honestly. <strong>On a 10+</strong>, also hold 2 points of <em>Insight</em>. You can spend each point of <em>Insight</em> on the following actions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ask another question about the situation from the list and get an honest answer.</li>
<li>Gain <em>Advantage</em> on a roll that you make to act on the GM’s answers.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="interfere">Interfere</h3>

<p>When you try <strong>to foil another PC’s action and neither of you backs down</strong>, roll with the RELEVANT STAT (per Defy Danger):</p>

<p><strong>On a 10+</strong>, the PC you’re interfering with chooses one action from the following list, and you still have options. <strong>On a 7&#8211;9</strong>, they choose one action, but you have no further options.</p>

<ul>
<li>Do it anyway, but with <em>Disadvantage</em> on their next roll.</li>
<li>Relent, change course, or otherwise allow their move to be foiled.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="parley">Parley</h3>

<p>When you <strong>press or entice a non-player character (NPC)</strong>, say what you want them to do (or not do). If they have no reason to resist, they comply. If they have a reason to resist, roll +CHA. <strong>On a 10+</strong>, they either do as you want or reveal the easiest way to persuade them. <strong>On a 7&#8211;9</strong>, they reveal something you can do to persuade them, but it’ll be costly, tricky, or distasteful.</p>

<p>When you <strong>press or entice a PC and they resist</strong>, you can roll +Bonds. <strong>On a 10+</strong>, choose both outcomes from the following list. <strong>On a 7&#8211;9</strong>, choose one.</p>

<ul>
<li>If they do what you want, they gain a point of XP.</li>
<li>They must do what you want or reveal how you could persuade them to do so.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="spout-lore">Spout Lore</h3>

<p>When you <strong>consult your accumulated knowledge about something</strong>, roll +INT. <strong>On a 10+</strong>, the GM tells you something interesting, useful, and relevant about the subject. <strong>On a 7&#8211;9</strong>, the GM tells you something interesting—it’s up to you to make it useful or relevant.</p>

<h2 id="battle-moves">Battle Moves</h2>

<p>The following moves are available to all character classes of any level.</p>

<h3 id="defend">Defend</h3>

<p>When you <strong>take up a defensive stance or protect a person, place, or thing</strong>, roll +CON. <strong>On a 10+</strong>, hold 3 points of <em>Readiness</em>. <strong>On a 7&#8211;9</strong>, hold 1 point of <em>Readiness</em>. You can spend each point of <em>Readiness</em> on the following actions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Suffer an attack’s damage/effects, instead of the entity that you’re defending.</li>
<li>Halve an attack’s damage/effects.</li>
<li>Draw all attention from the entity that you’re defending to yourself.</li>
<li>Strike back at the attacker, hitting automatically and dealing damage with <em>Disadvantage</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>When <strong>you go on the offensive, you stop defending, or the danger passes</strong>, you lose any remaining points of <em>Readiness</em> that you hold.</p>

<h3 id="hack-slash">Hack &amp; Slash</h3>

<p>When you <strong>fight in melee or close quarters</strong>, roll +STR. <strong>On a 10+</strong>, your maneuver works as intended, you deal your damage, and you choose one of the following actions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Evade, prevent, or otherwise counter the enemy’s reprisal.</li>
<li>Roll your damage a second time but suffer the enemy’s reprisal.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>On a 7&#8211;9</strong>, your maneuver mostly works, and you deal your damage. However, you suffer the enemy’s reprisal.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>When your <strong>attack could damage multiple enemies</strong>, roll Hack &amp; Slash once, but roll damage separately for each enemy.</li>
<li>When you <strong>gang up on an enemy</strong>, only one of you rolls Hack &amp; Slash, and the others Aid. If you deal damage, one of you rolls your damage with <em>Advantage</em>, and then adds +1 damage per attacker after the first.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="last-breath">Last Breath</h3>

<p>When <strong>your HP reaches 0</strong>, you catch a glimpse of what lies beyond the Black Gates of Death’s Kingdom, and then roll +0.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>On a 10+</strong>, you’ve cheated Death—you’re in a bad spot but you’re still alive.</li>
<li><strong>On a 7–9</strong>, Death himself offers you a bargain. Take it and stabilize or refuse and pass beyond the Black Gates into whatever fate awaits you.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="volley">Volley</h3>

</ul>

<h3 id="end-of-session">End of Session</h3>

<p>When you <strong>reach the end of a session</strong>, perform the following actions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Choose one of your bonds that you feel is resolved. Ask the player of the character with whom you have the bond if they agree. If they do, mark 1 point of XP. You can then write a new bond with that character.</li>
<li>Look at your Alignment Drive. If you fulfilled your Drive at least once in the session, mark 1 point of XP.</li>
