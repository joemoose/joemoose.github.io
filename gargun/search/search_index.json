Ancestor's Blessing You can bless yourself, another garg\u00fbn, or a friendly Warband. When you call upon your ancestors to bless someone , roll +WIS. On 10+ , your ancestors smile upon you. Your target takes +1 ongoing to Attack for the rest of the battle. On a 7-9 , as 10+, but! The uncanny glow surrounding them makes them attract unwanted attention. Ancestral Spirit Once per mission, you can summon a spirit of your ancestors to do your bidding. When you perform the summoning ritual , roll +CHR. On a 10+ , you summon the spirit and take 3 holds. On a 7-9 , as 10+, but! Take 1 hold. The summoned spirit is only partially in this world and cannot damage the living directly. It can absorb up to 12 HP of damage before disincorporating.

Instead, they rely on wild elemental magic that can sometime manifest with unintended consequences. When you channel garg\u00fbn elemental magic , describe the element you are channelling and the desired effect, then roll +INT. On a 10+ , the channelling works as intended, dealing 2d6 +INT damage if appropriate. On a 7-9 , as 10+, but! Choose one of the following: You draw unwanted attention.

Visions When you beseech your ancestors for guidance , roll +WIS. On a 10+ , your ancestors give you actionable details on what is to come; take 3 holds. On a 7-9 , you get a vague notion of what is to come but lack specifics; take 1 hold. Spend one hold to add +1 to any roll; your ancestors guide your hand to success.

When you try to injure someone , describe how you attack them: If you do it up close with clubs, knives, or bites, roll +STR. If you do it at a distance with spears or rocks, roll +DEX. On a 10+ , your attack connects, and you deal your damage. On a 7-9 , your attack connects, but! You are off-balance and exposed. Deal one-half of your total damage. The GM will tell you who takes advantage of your position. Run Away! When you avoid immediate danger , describe how: Through a surprising burst of strength, roll +STR. By moving quickly to duck out of the way, roll +DEX. By taking it on the chin, roll +CON. On a 10+ , you do what you set out to do, and the threat doesn't come to bear. On a 7-9 , you've bollixed it up. The GM will give you a hard bargain, a worse outcome, or an ugly choice. Lie Through Your Fangs When you try to BS or fast talk yourself out of a dire situation without offering anything in return, roll +INT. On a 10+ , you can pass off your lie. On a 7-9 , you can pass off your lie, but! You have to give something up or expose yourself to danger to put the lie over. Suss It Out When you try to figure out what the hell is going on , roll +WIS. On a 10+ , ask the GM two questions from the following list. On a 7\u20139 , ask one. Either way, take +1 forward when acting on the answers. What happened here recently? What is about to try and kill us, besides everything? What can we see that others would miss? How can I escape? Where is the shiny? Let's Make a Deal When you attempt to plead your case to non-garg\u00fbn , roll +CHA. On a 10+ , they listen long enough for you to offer them a deal; you can't always get what you want, but if you try sometimes, you just might find you get what you need. On a 7-9 , they're openly aggressive, and you'll need to sweeten the deal for them to even consider what you're offering. Abet or Thwart When you help or hinder another garg\u00fbn , roll +Teamwork. On a 10+ , you apply either a +1 or a -2 to the roll, your choice. On a 7\u20139 , as a roll of 10+, but! You expose yourself to danger, retribution, or cost. Tribal Knowledge When you explain the unknown by retelling the stories of your tribe , roll +Ingenuity. On a 10+ , a detailed story explains precisely this situation; tell it. Take +1 forward when acting on this information. On a 7-9 , there are some hints or vague legends; what are they? The Tribe Moves Tribe Starting Moves Round Up When you recruit additional garg\u00fbn to help with a task , give an inspiring speech and roll +Teamwork. On a 10+ , you gain two Warbands of garg\u00fbn. On a 7-9 , you gain one Warband of garg\u00fbn. On a miss , the tribe's lack of faith in you is demoralizing. All garg\u00fbn player characters take -2 forward. Note: When you take Warbands from the Tribe, reduce your population respectively\u2014one Warband equals one population\u2014until you bring those Warbands back to the tribe. Run and Hide! When your tribe is raided by murderous outsiders , roll +Secrecy. On a 10+ , the raiders couldn't find any of your tribe; no population is lost. On a 7-9 , the raiders found some of your tribe but didn\u2019t find your lair! Subtract d6 from your tribe's population. On a miss , the murder hobos found your lair and slaughtered your tribe; loose 2d6 population. Zug Zug! When a garg\u00fbn player character returns from a mission and shares the resources obtained , your tribe enters a breeding frenzy. Reset an appropriate Want clock and roll +Hardiness. On a 10+ , add d6 to your population. On a 7-9 , add d6 to your population, but add a new Want. On a miss , the distraction of the breeding season has opened you up to disaster! The GM immediately brings an external pressure to bear on the tribe. Stockpiles When a garg\u00fbn character returns from a mission and hoards the resources obtained instead of sharing them, roll +Ingenuity. On a 10+ , the tribe gains three stockpile hold. On a 7-9 , the tribe gains one stockpile hold. Note: Stockpiles holds persist between sessions. Spend one hold at anytime to move a Want progress clock back one tick. Tribe Advanced Moves The following Advanced Tribe Moves cost 7 XP each. A Bit of the Ultra-Violence Your garg\u00fbn have grown up extra bloodthirsty! They deal an additional d4 damage when attacking up close in melee. Huddle Up When you pack together for defence during combat, roll +Warfare. On a 10+ , all garg\u00fbn involved gain +1 armour for the rest of combat. On a 7-9 , all garg\u00fbn involved gain +1 armour until a garg\u00fbn falls. Bounty of the Wild By scavenging, your Tribe can alleviate a Want. Whenever you reset a Want clock, roll +Teamwork. On a 10+ , reduce another Want clock by three ticks. On a 7-9 , reduce another Want clock by one tick. Fuck You, We Have a... Your Tribe gains a mighty protector! Of course, they want something in return. ...Wizard! A mysterious wizard has taken up residence in your lair. Gain four homunculi Warbands (d6 damage, 10 HP). ...Troll! A mighty troll has taken up residence in your lair. Gain one troll Warband (d12 damage, 20 HP, regenerates one hit points per round). ...Necromancer! A foul necromancer has taken up residence in your lair. Gain five skeleton Warbands (d6 damage, 8 HP, mindless ). Gain an additional skeleton Warband each time your village breeds. ...Drake! A legendary drake (or is it a dragon?) has taken up residence in your lair! Gain one drake Warband (2d8 damage, 40 HP, terrifying ). Notes: This move can be taken multiple times, but only in the listed order. These sorts of creatures aren\u2019t known for sharing. Each time a new protector moves into your lair, they run off the previous protector. Thus, you can only have one protector at a time. You may spend additional XP to skip a protector level. For example, spend 14 XP to skip the Wizard and go straight to Troll when you first select this move. Each protector demands some new Want from the tribe. Describe specifically what it is and how to obtain it. If a protector dies, its Warband is gone forever. You may, however, still acquire the next level protector. When a protector leaves the tribe for any reason, their specific Want goes with them. You don\u2019t have to find more rotten fish to feed your troll after it's killed by a murder hobo. Hardy Garg\u00fbn Your garg\u00fbn are tougher than most garg\u00fbn thanks to a cruel Spartan upbringing. They roll 2d8 (instead of 1d6) keeping the highest d8 for their hit points. All active garg\u00fbn player characters may re-roll their hit points when this move is initially taken. Garg\u00fbn Sawbones The tribe has passed down a few jars of leeches from generation to generation. There are now healers (kinda) in your tribe. When you return to your lair after a mission and seek healing , roll +Ingenuity. On a 10 +, the leeches worked! Recover all lost HP. On a 7-9 , perhaps a little too much bloodletting, recover one-half of your lost HP. On a miss , well, they didn't think you needed that organ, take d4 damage. Garg\u00fbn Riders Your garg\u00fbn are now mounted warriors! Describe what your garg\u00fbn ride and how they domesticated these beasts. Your garg\u00fbn character always succeed when you try to escape combat. Add an external pressure to describe a predator that hunts your mounts. Boom! Warbands You now can recruit garg\u00fbn Sapper Warbands in addition to regular garg\u00fbn Warbands. These suicidal sappers deal d4 +Warfare damage and have 4 +Hardiness HP and the special move EXPLOSIVE . Any garg\u00fbn character can trigger the sapper's EXPLOSIVE move: the sapper Warband deals 2d8 damage to all nearby Warbands, including allies, and is destroyed. All for One! Any number of garg\u00fbn player characters may join together as a Warband during battle. The garg\u00fbn now attack as a single Warband unit dealing d12 damage + the total number joined . Any damage taken by the Warband is spread evenly amongst the garg\u00fbn player characters in the Warband. The Warband is dissolved after three rounds or as soon as one of the garg\u00fbn player characters fall. Lair Fortifications Your Tribe has improved the defences of its lair. Describe how. Whenever your Tribe is raided, roll your population loss twice and take the lower result. Lair Improvements Increase a single Tribe stat by +1 to a maximum of +3. Describe how the Tribe improves the lair. Loc-Nar You\u2019ve unearthed a magical totem in your lair. What the heck is it? All garg\u00fbn player characters immediately gain +1 to any single stat. Master Tribe Moves The following Master Tribe Moves cost 14 XP each. Any moves marked with * becomes a basic move for all garg\u00fbn player characters. Boffins Garg\u00fbn player characters gain a new ability. Each subsequent generation gains 2 +WIS abilities rather than 1 +WIS. Gargosians The tribe is now able to share simple thoughts and feelings. Whenever a garg\u00fbn character is in the company of other garg\u00fbn and would roll +INT, you may now roll +Ingenuity instead. This ability has a distinct visual effect. Explain what it is and how others react to it. Garg\u00fbn Angry! * When you unleash your inner garg\u00fbn rage and charge an enemy Warband , roll +Warfare. On a 10+ , your anger is ferocious! Gain +2 to STR and -1 to CON for five rounds. On a 7-9 , it seems like you\u2019re kinda upset but not really feeling it today. Gain +1 to STR and -2 to CON for five rounds, and you cannot unleash your rage again until the next mission. Some Words Have Power * Thoughts have a certain sound. That being the equivalent to a form. Through sound and motion, you would be able to paralyze nerves, shatter bones, set fires, suffocate an enemy or burst his organs. Or something like that. Probably just the paralyze thing. When you speak the power word , roll +Hardiness. On a 10+ , you paralyze your target. On a 7-9 , you paralyze your target and choose two of the following: You draw unwanted attention. You take d4 damage from the strain of the word. You are knocked back and fall prone. Spot Me, Bro Your Tribe has learned to work well together when attempting feats of strength, thanks to excellent workout routines by the elders. Whenever a garg\u00fbn character is in the company of other garg\u00fbn and would roll +STR, you may now roll +Warfare instead. Ten Mouths are Better Than One Your Tribe has learned to play off each other\u2019s lies and grovelling, making you all more convincing and pathetic as a group. Whenever a garg\u00fbn character is in the company of other garg\u00fbn and would roll +CHR, you may now roll +Teamwork instead. Wondergargu Powers Activate! * When you enlist a friendly Warband to aid you in your actions , roll +Teamwork. On a 10+ , take +3 forward as the Warband comes to your aid. On a 7\u20139 , take +1 forward, but the boneheads suffer d4 damage helping you.","title":"Moves"},{"location":"DW%20Gargun%20Moves/#moves","text":"","title":"Moves"},{"location":"DW%20Gargun%20Moves/#gargun-player-character-basic-moves","text":"","title":"Garg\u00fbn Player Character Basic Moves"},{"location":"DW%20Gargun%20Moves/#attack","text":"When you try to injure someone , describe how you attack them: If you do it up close with clubs, knives, or bites, roll +STR.

The Tribe is the game's central character representing the entire warren of garg\u00fbn struggling to succeed in a harsh world. A consensus of all the players determines the actions of the Tribe. The welfare and progression of the Tribe are paramount to the game. Warbands are where much of the combat against enemies of the Tribe occurs. Warbands are groups of garg\u00fbn working together as a single unit. Warbands allow for easy resolution of large scale conflicts against, for example, mobs of pitchfork-wielding villagers, packs of slavering wargs, trolls, or those pesky bands of adventurers forever skulking in the hidden places of the land. Individual Garg\u00fbn is the level at which players control the actions of a singular garg\u00fbn character and its progeny. These Garg\u00fbn player characters are the champions of the Tribe. Accomplishing special missions and heroic deeds is typical fare at the individual level. Tribe Tribe Stats Your Tribe has the following stats: Hardiness, Ingenuity, Teamwork, Secrecy, and Warfare. Hardiness : Your Tribe's overall health and toughness Ingenuity : How clever and industrious your Tribe is in the face of danger Teamwork : How well your Tribe works together toward common goals Secrecy : How well your Tribe keeps itself hidden from outsiders Warfare : How well your Tribe can go on the offensive to protect itself These stats modify Tribe Moves dice rolls and occasionally individual garg\u00fbn player character Moves. Wants Wants are anything that your Tribe might need to survive and thrive, such as food, water, gold for your pet dragon's hoard, or sacrifices to stave off the wrath of your ancestors' spirits. Wants can only be satisfied by finding a resource outside the Tribe's lair and retrieving it with a successful mission. The GM will advance a progress clock associated with a Want throughout the session whenever you roll a miss on a Move. Consider the clock as a countdown for running out of resources for that Want. Completing missions and returning with resources reset the progress clocks. If a clock fills, your Tribe loses population. External Pressures External Pressures are all the horrible things in the world baleful to a garg\u00fbn tribe. Some pressures are inherent to the region in which your Tribe dwells. The GM might reveal new pressures resulting from Moves or events in the narrative as the game progresses. External Pressures each have a progress clock of their own, and the GM advances it anytime your Tribe resets a Want. The clock might advance in response to failed moves or events in the narrative as well. Once the clock for an external pressure fills, adversity befalls the Tribe. Experience Points The Tribe gains one point of XP anytime a garg\u00fbn player character or the Tribe miss on a Move roll. Players use the accumulated XP to acquire new Tribe Moves: 7 XP for an Advanced Move and 14 XP for a Master Move. You can select new Tribe Moves anytime the garg\u00fbn player characters are not on a mission. Losing the Game Garg\u00fbn existence can be grim. Death is a constant companion. If your Tribe's population falls to zero, game over, man! Warbands Any character in the game that isn't an individual garg\u00fbn player character is treated as a Warband. A Warband can be anything from a swarm of smaller individuals to one humongous monster. Garg\u00fbn Warbands A garg\u00fbn Warband equals one point of the Tribe's population or about 10 garg\u00fbn. Population Reduction When you recruit Warbands from the Tribe, reduce your population respectively\u2014one point for each Warband recruited\u2014until you bring those Warbands back to the Tribe. Stats Garg\u00fbn Warbands deal d8 +Warfare damage and have 10 +Hardiness HP. Moves Garg\u00fbn Warbands can't do much independently and have no special moves besides charging in a straight line to attack an enemy Warband or fleeing in panic away from an enemy Warband. The master Tribe move Wondergargu Powers Activate! allows garg\u00fbn Warbands to directly assist in garg\u00fbn player character actions. Individual Garg\u00fbn Player Characters Stats Garg\u00fbn player characters have the six standard stats: Strength , Dexterity , Constitution , Intelligence , Wisdom , and Charisma . However, rather than the typical values of 3 to 18, Garg\u00fbn stats are simply the Move dice roll modifiers, ranging from a minimum of -2 to a maximum of +2. HP Individual Garg\u00fbn have 1d6 +CON hit points, with a minimum of 1. That isn't a lot so make them count. Damage Individual Garg\u00fbn do d6 damage on a successful attack regardless of the weapon. Abilities and Moves might increase this roll. Healing Upon returning to your Tribe after a mission, you may re-roll your hit points if you want. The result of this roll is your new hit point total, even if it's lower than what you had before you rolled. If a healer attends you\u2014using, for instance, the advanced Tribe move Garg\u00fbn Sawbones \u2014you can roll that Move instead. Dying When you die, you gain two Death Tokens . You can spend Death Tokens, 1 for 1, to improve another player's roll one level of success: a miss becomes a 7-9, or a 7-9 becomes a 10+. If you have not spent these tokens by the end of the mission, they are converted 2 for 1 into Tribe XP. Return to the Fight! You may spend two Death Tokens to immediately bring a new generation of your family into the fight. Explain how your new garg\u00fbn shows up, describe their abilities and looks, and then enter the fray! Otherwise, a fallen garg\u00fbn player character is replaced by one of its offspring upon the group completing their mission returning to the Tribe. Abilities Players don't choose among different playbooks for garg\u00fbn characters. Instead, you pick 2 +WIS abilities for the first generation of your garg\u00fbn character's lineage. Improving Your Garg\u00fbn Improvement? Levelling? Advancement? Oh, you. Garg\u00fbn don't advance; they breed. As a garg\u00fbn, you expect to live a year or two. The best thing you can do to protect your lineage is to have dozens of children and teach them your abilities. Individual garg\u00fbn don't gain XP. Instead, anytime you miss on a dice roll, the Tribe gains +1 XP, which goes into a shared pool that you can draw from to improve the Tribe. When your garg\u00fbn character dies (and it will), one of its progeny steps up to take their place. This youngster inherits its parent's stat block but increases a single stat by 1 (max +2). Stats may not be re-arranged from generation to generation, only slightly improved.
