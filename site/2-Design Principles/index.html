                <h1 id="design-principles">Design Principles</h1>
<p>The game design assumes the following principles.</p>
<p><strong>Neutrality</strong></p>
<p>The GM's role is to portray the rules, situations, NPCs, and narrative while acting as a neutral arbiter.</p>
<p><strong>Classless</strong></p>
<p>A single class does not limit a character's role or skills. Instead, the equipment they carry and their experiences define their speciality.</p>
<p><strong>Death</strong></p>
<p>Characters may be powerful, but they are also vulnerable to harm in many forms. Death is always around the corner, but it is never random or without warning.</p>
<p><strong>Fiction First</strong></p>
<p>Dice do not always reflect an obstacle's difficulty or its outcome. Instead, the GM arbitrates success and failure in dialogue with the players, based on in-world elements.</p>
<p><strong>Growth</strong></p>
<p>Characters are changed through in-world advancement, gaining new skills and abilities by surviving dangerous events and overcoming obstacles.</p>
<p><strong>Player Choice</strong></p>
<p>Players should always understand the reasons behind the choices they've made, and the GM provides information about potential risks freely and frequently.</p>
<p><strong>Principles</strong></p>
<p>The GM and the players agree to general principles that foster a specific play experience defined by critical thinking, exploration, and an emergent narrative.</p>
<p><strong>Shared Objectives</strong></p>
<p>Players trust one another to engage with the shared setting, character goals, and party challenges. Therefore, the party is typically working together towards a common goal as a team.</p>
<h2 id="principles-for-game-masters">Principles for Game Masters</h2>
<p>GMs abide by these general principles.</p>
<p><strong>Information</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Provide useful information about the game world as the characters explore it.</li>
<li>Players do not need to roll dice to learn about their circumstances.</li>
<li>Be helpful and direct with your answers to their questions.</li>
<li>Respond honestly, describe consistently, and always let them know they can keep asking questions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Difficulty</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Default to context and realism rather than numbers and mechanics.</li>
<li>If something the players want to do is sincerely impossible, no dice roll will allow them to do it.</li>
<li>Is what the player describes and how they leverage the situation sensible? Let it happen.</li>
<li>Ability Saves cover many uncertain situations and are often all that is necessary for risky actions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Preparation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The game world is organic, malleable, and random. It intuits and makes sharp turns.</li>
<li>Use random tables and generators to develop situations, not static stories or plots.</li>
<li>NPCs remember what the PCs say and do and how they affect the world.</li>
<li>NPCs don't want to die. Infuse their self-interest and will to live into every personality.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Narrative Focus</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Emergent experience of play is what matters, not math or character abilities. Give the players weapon trainers and personal quests to facilitate improvement and specialization.</li>
<li>Pay attention to the needs and wants of the players, then put realistic opportunities in their path.</li>
<li>A dagger to your throat will kill you, regardless of your expensive armour and special training.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Danger</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The game world produces a real risk of pain and death for the player characters.</li>
<li>Telegraph danger to players when it is present. The more dangerous, the more apparent.</li>
<li>Put traps in plain sight and let the players take time to figure out a solution.</li>
<li>Give players opportunities to solve problems and interact with the world.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Choice</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Give players a solid choice to force outcomes when the narrative lulls.</li>
<li>Use binary "so, A or B?" responses when their intentions are vague.</li>
<li>Work together with this conversational progress to keep the game moving.</li>
<li>Ensure that the player character's actions leave their mark on the game world.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="principles-for-players">Principles for Players</h2>
<p>Players abide by these general principles.</p>
<p><strong>Agency</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ability scores and related saves do not define your character. They are tools.</li>
<li>Don't only ask what your character would do; ask what you would do, too.</li>
<li>Be creative with your intuition, items, and connections.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Teamwork</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Seek consensus from the other players before barreling forward.</li>
<li>Stay on the same page about goals and limits, respecting each other and accomplishing more as a group than alone.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exploration</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Asking questions and listening to detail is more valuable than any stats, items, or skills you have.</li>
<li>Take the GM's description without suspicion, but never hesitate to clarify or seek more information.</li>
<li>There is no single correct way forward.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Talking</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Treat NPCs as if they were real people, and rely on your curiosity to safely gain information and solve problems.</li>
<li>You'll find that most people are interesting and will want to talk things through before getting violent.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Caution</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fighting is a choice and rarely a wise one; consider whether violence is the best way to achieve your goals.</li>
<li>Try to stack the odds in your favour and retreat when things seem unfavourable.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Planning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Think of ways to avoid your obstacles through reconnaissance, subtlety, and fact-finding.</li>
<li>Do some research and ask around about your objectives.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ambition</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Set goals and use your resources to take steps forward.</li>
<li>Expect nothing. Earn your reputation.</li>
<li>Keep things moving forward and play to see what happens.</li>
</ul>
