<p><strong>ARMI Cooking Stove, Flameless</strong>: Plastic tub stove with a metal liner, into which pre-cooked food can be placed. A heat block is put underneath the metal tray and activated by water. The lid is sealed, and the block heats up to thoroughly warm the food. It will be piping hot within 20 minutes. There is no flame, and the heat does not penetrate the plastic box. Ration packs always include a couple of heat blocks to heat the food. Cost $40.
Mass 1 kg.</p>
<p><strong>Aquatech 3-Series Rebreather</strong>: Extracts oxygen from water to allow the wearer to breathe for an unlimited time underwater. Functions only on worlds with thin, standard, or dense (type 4 through 9) atmospheres. Cost $4,000. Mass 4 kg.</p>
<p><strong>Aquatech Pro-Swim 600 Dive Set</strong>: Includes swim fins, wet suit, face mask. Protects against the effects of cold (50 Celsius or below) and improves speed and manoeuvrability underwater; add DM +1 to all movement skill checks in these situations when wearing proper swimming equipment. Cost $200. Mass 3kg.</p>
<p><strong>Bintang RELY Oxygen Tanks</strong>: A complete set of compressed oxygen tanks with mask, protective goggles and carry straps; they allow independent breathing in smoke, dust, gas, underwater or in an exotic (type A) atmosphere. Two tanks last 6 hours. Cost $2000. Mass 4 kg.</p>
<p><strong>Cold Weather Clothing</strong>: Protects against bitterly cold weather (-20Â° C or below). Adds a DM+2 to all Endurance checks made to resist the effects of cold weather exposure. Various brands offer arctic clothing, including Novomo, Bauspace, KNiTK, and YoYo. Cost $200. Mass kg.</p>
<p><strong>Haruna Priority First Aid Kit</strong>: A small medical kit carried on a pouch that fits onto a rucksack or belt. It contains basic items, bandages, a pressure dressing, antibiotics, painkillers, eye-wash, antihistamines and plasters. It contains enough supplies for two wound treatments. Cost $50. Mass 0.5kg</p>
<p><strong>Haruna Serious Trauma Kit</strong>: A comprehensive medical bag used by a paramedic or doctor to deal with serious injuries. The immediate responder trauma and first aid backpack is a complete system. The kit was initially designed for company safety personnel, first aid departments, disaster preparation and emergency response teams that would need to get to injured people and provide care on the scene. The high-vis, red backpack is organised into separate sections covering everything from burns to fractures, anaphylaxis to choking injuries, heart attacks, etc. Contains enough supplies for six major treatments. Cost $350. Mass 6kg.</p>
<p><strong>Kinako BB6 Basic Bubble</strong>: A large (2m diameter) pressurised and transparent plastic bubble. Piezoelectric layers in the bubble wall translate the user's movements into electricity. CO recharge the bubble's batteries and power its distress beacon, and a small oxygen tank inflates the bubble and provides two-person/hours of life support. There is no airlock. Rescue bubbles can sometimes be found on space vessels and watercraft as emergency lifeboats. Cost $600. Mass 2 kg.</p>
<p><strong>Kinako Sunrise Ration Pack</strong>: A 24-hour ration pack provides a range of meals and snacks for one person for a single day and includes 1 litre of additional water for cooking and making hot drinks. Cost $30. Mass 2kg.</p>

<p><strong>Lunar D-FEND Electric Fence</strong>: This portable electric fence is 1m high and 30m long; it is mounted on 15 aluminium stakes and can be rolled up and slid into a 1m long carry bag.
It comes with a rechargeable power cell that has a duration of 4 days. The charge given off acts as a mild irritant, similar to the stock fences used in agriculture; it will deter small to mid-sized creatures. Still, larger herbivores and carnivores probably won't even notice it. Cost $600. Mass 10kg.</p>
<p><strong>MagLite ML5 Lantern</strong>: Folding lantern for illumination of a campsite. It comes with an hour power cell and has a wire handle for carrying or hanging from a branch or tent pole. Cost $30. Mass 1.5kg.</p>
<p><strong>Reiner-Gama 200 Portable Diesel Generator</strong>: A portable power unit can be invaluable in an environment without electricity. This 7000-watt generator can fit in the back of a four-wheel-drive; it provides continuous electricity for hours and includes a charging adaptor for most power cells. It runs on diesel, requiring 20 litres for a full tank and has an electric starter. Be warned that the generator is a diesel engine and makes a lot of noise. Cost $4500. Mass 170kg (with a full tank).</p>
<p><strong>Reiner-Gama 347 Portable Fusion Generator</strong>: This is a heavy-duty portable fusion generator capable of recharging or powering equipment for six months. Cost $500,000. Mass 170 kg.</p>
<p><strong>Rockford Aerospace Advanced Thruster Unit (ATU)</strong>: A gas-fueled thruster pack allows the user to manoeuvre in zero-gravity. A Vacc Suit skill check is required to use a thruster pack accurately. Thruster packs can only be used in zero-G environments and are only practical for journeys between spacecraft at Adjacent range. Cost $2,000. Mass kg.</p>
<p><strong>Tharsis H-10 Survival Suit</strong>: Designed to protect the wearer from extreme cold or heat (-50Â°C to +50Â°C), the environment suit has a hood, gloves and boots. Cost $500. Mass 2 kg.</p>
<p><strong>Tharsis M2 Ablative Canopy Orbital Re-entry (ACOR)</strong>: A personal re-entry kit, allowing a vacc-suited individual to enter a planetary atmosphere, survive and parachute to the ground. This is a dangerous undertaking, usually practised by US Marines. ACOR packs are enormous and cumbersome, but when out of the airlock, the user can activate the system, which inflates: 5m diameter ballute behind, with him in the centre. The guidance computer and thruster unit which lay along his chest is now swung up, extended and activated. The descent begins with the ablative foam within the ballute sloughing off with the intense heat and friction. At an altitude of 15,000', the main chute will deploy. The total time from orbit to touchdown is around 30-40 minutes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>ACOR: Surviving Re-entry</strong></p>
<p>ACOR users must make an Average (+0) Vacc Suit roll to make a successful re-entry. Apply the following DMs:</p>
<p>+1 Computer skill<br>
+1 Navigation skill<br>
+1 Pilot skill<br>
+2 Marine career<br>
+2 World Size 1<br>
+1 World size 2<br>
-2 Atmosphere B<br>
-4 Atmosphere C<br></p>
<p>Failure indicates being off course or landing in a dangerous situation. Success shows a perfect landing. A natural roll of âdouble 2â means death or severe injury.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Yoshiko 567-8801 Sleeping Bag</strong>: A warm and compact sleeping bag. Cost $35. Mass 1.5kg.</p>
<p><strong>Yoshiko AD321 Floodlight</strong>: A portable LED floodlight mounted on a telescopic pole. The pole ends in four legs and can be pegged into the ground. At the base of each light is a rechargeable power cell. The floodlight has power for 16 hours of continuous operation. Cost $400. Mass 8kg.</p>
<p><strong>Yoshiko GP Surface Mask</strong>: An ordinary Off-World survival mask that can filter contaminants, taints, smoke and dust (atmosphere types 4, 7, and 7, 9) but that can also compress breathed air to allow survival in a low-pressure atmosphere (types 2 and 3). Useful in Very Thin or Tainted atmospheres. Cost $150. Mass negligible.</p>
