    <h1 id="androids">Androids</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The modern android is a human-like, electromechanical cyborg designed for harsh conditions or monotonous tasks (or both).
Built around a sturdy carbon fibre skeleton is a complex system of silicon muscles that stabilises and controls. An outer covering of bio-plastic sheeting is built upon a layer of flexible collagenous fibres. The most modern androids operate with a Model/4 computer running either a level 1, 2 or 3 Intellect program.</p>
<p>Power is provided for around three months by a 25 kW fuel cell requiring liquid hydrogen fuel. Androids do not need to breathe, drink or eat. Still, they occasionally ingest a pale-coloured, semi-organic nutrient suspension in a silicon-based liquid medium that serves as a lubricant for the system's micro hydraulics. </p>
<p>It is prudent for androids to wear vacc suits or hostile environment suits since machinery, processor, fuel cell, and outer skin are susceptible to damage. Vacuum, high pressure, high temperature and aggressive atmospheric chemical constituents can irreparably damage an android. The cost of a single unit precludes the avoidable and wasteful use of an android in such an environment.</p>
<p>Most androids are competent and of average human intelligence. They are generally programmed with passive, non-aggressive personalities and given the likeness of mature (30-40-year-old) male or female. The aim is to blend in, join in, be a team player within a group of humans, support the leadership and provide valuable options and advice without being forceful. 
All androids are ordered from Transdyne Cybersystems directly. All are custom-made and ready for delivery within 6 to 10 months. Buyers must specify their preferred options. To build an android, begin with a chassis, add software,  and any preferred options.</p>
<h3 id="repair-station">Repair Station</h3>
<p>Androids require an upright repair station, massing around 200 kg into which the android itself steps. A transparent lid then closes, and the android plugs in and undergoes a diagnostic and lubricant change. The fuel cell is topped up with liquid hydrogen if needed. Typically, androids will require a check-up every month or after sustaining damage. </p>

<h2 id="modifications">Modifications</h2>
<h3 id="amplified-hearing">Amplified Hearing</h3>
<p>Can zoom in on sounds within 100m if the character concentrates and hears things out of normal hearing, such as low or high-frequency sounds. DM+2 on hearing rolls (usually Intelligence rolls). $50,000</p>
<h3 id="brain-bomb">Brain Bomb</h3>
<p>If the android is within 20km of a transmitter, a single command will detonate the explosives, killing the synth. $150,000</p>
<h3 id="combat-chassis">Combat Chassis</h3>
<p>The musculature and skeleton are reinforced with alloys and graphenes for long, punishing combat missions, making routine maintenance unnecessary. Also, the skull and chest and electrical pathways are encased in armour. This provides an Armor Rating of 9 and +2 Strength. In addition, this swaps out the usual fuel cell for a micro-fusion reactor or radio thermal generator with a ten-year lifespan. $2,000,000, +25 kg.</p>
<h3 id="enhanced-musculature">Enhanced Musculature</h3>
<p>Extra fibres are added around the body, and alloy strengthens the chassis. Gives +2 on Strength rolls. Not compatible with Combat Chassis. $120,000.
Expert Balance: Superb balance and coordination. No rolls are required for walking along tight ropes, ledges, etc. Running does, however. Reduce distance from a fall by 3m. $50,000</p>
<h3 id="flexibility">Flexibility</h3>
<p>The android’s limbs are double-jointed, giving +3 to slip out of bindings, climb rolls, and the ability to climb into tiny spaces. This may occasionally help with repair rolls, too. $75,000</p>
<h3 id="high-low-temperature-protection">High-Low Temperature Protection</h3>
<p>Protects the android chassis and brain from frozen or inferno temperature worlds. $100,000 Optical</p>
<h3 id="radiation-shielding">Radiation Shielding</h3>
<p>Provides 200 rad protection against radiation bursts. $100,000</p>
<h3 id="radio-scanner">Radio Scanner</h3>
<p>A radio link using sub-vocalisation, range 20 km. It can detect transmitting bugs, too. Double cost to splice in a video feed. $10,000</p>
<h3 id="reflex-accelerator">Reflex Accelerator</h3>
<p>This wires the android’s physical reflexes to an inhuman level. Popular with combat androids. For two minutes, the synth can act twice every combat round. It cannot be reused within one hour. If the android is damaged, then the acceleration will automatically shut off. $250,000 </p>
<h3 id="second-skin">Second Skin</h3>
<p>The android is immune to fire and napalm attacks by virtue of a second iso-thermic outer skin. Within minutes this skin sheds. The new second skin will regrow during time within the repair station. $60,000</p>
<h3 id="subdermal-body-armour">Subdermal Body Armour</h3>
<p>Provides Armor Rating +4 covering the silicon musculature (which has a default AR of 3). Not compatible with Combat Chassis. $100,000</p>
<h3 id="subdermal-pouch">Subdermal Pouch</h3>
<p>A secret sub-skin carry-pouch for small items. $20,000</p>
<h3 id="tool-kit">Tool Kit</h3>
<p>The android’s arms and hands are built with folding and extendible tools of several types. $50,000.</p>
<h3 id="vacuum-protection">Vacuum Protection</h3>
<p>Protects the android chassis and brain from a vacuum or low pressure. $100,000 Vision, Anti-Dazzle: Protects the eyes from flares, flash-bombs, strobes etc. $50,000.</p>
<h3 id="vibration-detection">Vibration Detection</h3>
<p>Sensitive microphones in the android’s feet can detect any movement on the ground by animals, men, or machines out to 500m with an Average Intelligence roll. $80,000.</p>
<h3 id="video-camera">Video Camera</h3>
<p>Can record or stream to a receiver within 20 km. $50,000</p>
<h3 id="vision-enhanced-peripheral">Vision, Enhanced Peripheral</h3>
<p>Independently focused eyes can simultaneously look in two different directions. $50,000.</p>
<h3 id="vision-infra-red">Vision, Infra-Red</h3>
<p>Can see in total darkness using only heat emissions. $50,000.</p>
<h3 id="vision-low-light">Vision, Low-Light</h3>
<p>Provides good night vision provided some light iS available, even a tiny LED. $50,000.</p>
<h3 id="vision-microscopic">Vision, Microscopic</h3>
<p>Micro-vision is suitable for checking fibres, analysing flora and fauna, marks on shell casings, and other evidence or clues. $40,000</p>
<h3 id="vision-telescopic">Vision, Telescopic</h3>
<p>The sight zooms in just by concentrating. In good conditions, a character may be able to spot a human-sized figure up to 5km away. $40,000</p>
<h3 id="vocal-mimicry">Vocal Mimicry</h3>
<p>After spending a minute listening, the android can mimic a voice or sounds but only repeat what is heard. If it spends an hour listening and makes an Intelligence roll, it can imitate the voice in general conversation. $90,000</p>
