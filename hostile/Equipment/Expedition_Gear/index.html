<p><strong>Aldine ARB Radiation Badge</strong>: Indicates presence and intensity of radioactivity within a 30-meter radius. The indicating signal will grow stronger as it gets closer to the source. Cost $50. Mass negl.</p>
<p><strong>Aldine Colonial 1200 Rucksack</strong>: A waterproof 40-litre rucksack, with side and front pockets and equipment straps below and above. It includes attachments for a Hydro-Pack. Holds roughly 25kg of kit. Cost: $80. Mass negligible.</p>
<p><strong>Aldine Metal Detector</strong>: Indicates the presence of metal within a 3-meter radius (including underground), with the indicating signal growing louder as it gets closer to the source. Cost $550. Mass 2kg.</p>
<p><strong>Aquatech 3-Series Rebreather</strong>: Extracts oxygen from water to allow the wearer to breathe for an unlimited time underwater. Functions only on worlds with thin, standard, or dense (type 4 through 9) atmospheres. Cost $4,000. Mass 4 kg.</p>
<p><strong>Aquatech Pro-Swim 600 Dive Set</strong>: Includes swim fins, wet suit, face mask. Protects against the effects of the cold (5o Celsius or below), along with improving speed and manoeuvrability underwater; add DM +1 to all movement skill checks in these situations when wearing proper swimming equipment. Cost $200. Mass 3kg.</p>
<p><strong>Aquatech Ranger-100 Raft</strong>: A one-person survival raft used to cross rivers. It is inflatable with a small foot-pump and will carry either one person or 100kg of equipment. $120. Mass 2kg.</p>
<p><strong>ARMI Magnetic Compass</strong>: Indicates direction of magnetic north, if any exists. Cost $20. Mass negl.</p>
<p><strong>Bintang RELY Oxygen Tanks</strong>: A complete set of compressed oxygen tanks with mask, protective goggles and carry straps; they allow independent breathing in smoke, dust, gas, underwater or in an exotic (type A) atmosphere. Two tanks last 6 hours. Cost $2000. Mass 4 kg.</p>
<p><strong>Gerber Grapnel</strong>: A small, lightweight, folding grapnel used for climbing, but with many other uses too, as a pick or even an anchor! Cost $30. Mass 0.200kg. Combat: Close Quarter Range, DM -1, 2D6.</p>
<p><strong>Gulfstar INS44 Inertial Nav System</strong>: A hand-held or belt-mounted device which indicates direction and distance travelled from the starting location, usually imaging directly into a preloaded map set for precision navigation. Cost $1,000. Mass 1.5kg.</p>
<p><strong>Gulfstar PLB2 Personal Locator Beacon</strong>: A wrist-mounted emergency beacon with a range (once activated) of up to 10 km. The PLB uses a standard emergency frequency that can be tracked by any modern avionics system, Gulfstar Hand Radio, or Novomo EM Scanner. The signal will last for 24 hours. Cost $100. Mass negl.</p>
<p><strong>Inferno Electronics J34 Motion Tracker</strong>: The Inferno Electronics J34 Motion Tracker is a hand-held unit with a simple shoulder strap that uses discriminatory Doppler shift ultra-sound scanning to detect movement within a 100-degree cone ahead of the operator. Range varies, from 10-20m indoors to almost 600-800m in open country. They are useful tools, but subject to varied limitations, anything that moves can show up on the reading if not properly tuned out, extremely slow-moving objects may not show up at all, and of course, any enemy listening in will probably detect the loud ultra-sound bursts being emitted from the J34. The referee makes an Average Comms roll on the playerâ€™s behalf to operate a motion tracker. With success, he can give the player a pretty accurate indication of what the scanner is picking up; if unsuccessful, he should give the player false data. Player involvement can be increased by letting them roll one of the 2D6, with the referee rolling the other in secret. Cost: $1680. Mass 1kg.</p>
<p><strong>Inferno Electronics T10 Solar Base</strong>: A fold-out solar power charger, only 15cm wide when folded. Able to charge flashlights, lamps, radios, nav units, night-vision goggles, etc., but time to recharge depends on the device's typical power usage and the available daylight. Cost: $50. Mass: 0.3kg</p>
<p><strong>Haruna Priority First Aid Kit</strong>: A small medical kit carried on a pouch that fits onto a rucksack or belt. It contains basic items, bandages, a pressure dressing, antibiotics, painkillers, eye-wash, antihistamines and plasters. It contains enough supplies for two wound treatments. Cost $50. Mass 0.5kg</p>
<p><strong>Lunar D-FEND Electric Fence</strong>: This portable electric fence is 1m high and 30m long; it is mounted on 15 aluminium stakes and can be rolled up and slid into a 1m long carry bag. It comes with a rechargeable power cell that has four days. The charge given off acts as a mild irritant, similar to the stock fences used in agriculture; it will deter small to mid-sized creatures. Still, larger herbivores and carnivores probably wonâ€™t even notice it. Cost $600. Mass 10kg.</p>
<p><strong>M1967 Folding Spade</strong>: A folding military shovel that packs down to the size of a baseball glove and fits into a snug protective case. One edge of the blade is serrated, allowing it to be used as a crude saw. This is a handy piece of equipment. Cost $30. Mass 1.5 kg. Combat: Close Quarters Range, DM -2, 2D6. </p>
<p><strong>Norden LSGS Flashlight</strong>: A waterproof and impact-resistant flashlight, roughly 20 cm in length, with an endurance of 6 hours. A flashlight produces a wide cone of light up to 18 meters long with a radius of 6 meters at the end of the beam. Cost $120. Mass 1kg.</p>
<p><strong>Norden LSAA Head-torch</strong>: A powerful little head-torch, its use allows hands-free illumination. Cost $70. Mass 200g.</p>
<p><strong>Novomo Forge Heavy Duty Axe</strong>: A polymer handled heavy-duty self-sharpening axe for camping, emergency rescue, construction, etc. Comes with a protective case for the steel axe-head. Cost $30. Mass 2.5 kg. Combat: Extended Reach Range, DM -1, 3D6.</p>
<p><strong>Novomo Pro-Series EM Scanner</strong>: This device detects the electromagnetic emissions of technological devices and can be used as a diagnostic tool when examining equipment (+1 DM to work out whatâ€™s wrong with it) or when searching for hidden bugs or devices. The Comms skill can be used to sweep a room for bugs. Cost $450. Mass 200g.</p>
<p><strong>Reiner-Gama 200 Portable Diesel Generator</strong>: A portable power unit can be invaluable in an environment without electricity. This 7000-watt generator can fit in the back of a four-wheel-drive; it provides continuous electricity for 7 hours and includes a charging adaptor for most power cells. It runs on diesel, requiring 20 litres for a full tank and has an electric starter. Be warned that the generator is a diesel engine and makes a lot of noise. Cost $4500. Mass 170kg (with a full tank).</p>
<p><strong>Reiner-Gama 347 Portable Fusion Generator</strong>: This is a heavy-duty portable fusion generator capable of recharging or powering equipment for six months. Cost $500,000. Mass 170 kg.</p>
<p><strong>Reiner-Gama 101 Night-Vision Goggles</strong>: These unobtrusive goggles allow good vision in near-total darkness, as long as some starlight or another ambient light is enhanced. Cost $500. Mass 200g.</p>
<p><strong>Sanga Capture Net, Small</strong>: A tough net, four sq. meters in size, used to catch small animals. It has other uses, too. $50. 2kg.</p>

The wristwatch has a stopwatch feature and life signs monitor function. It is digital. Cost $200. Mass negl.</p>
<p><strong>Sony Matrix DD1018 Digital Camera</strong>A hand-held digital camera capable of still photography and video. It is capable of low-light photography and includes an in-built timer. The camera can take 300 still shots or up to two hours of video. It can be plugged directly into any computer to download images and videos. Cost $500. Mass 1kg.</p>
<p><strong>Stern PA58 Hard Case</strong>: Tough steel cargo case (32x20x22cm) perfect for carrying ammunition, equipment or supplies. It features a waterproof rubber seal and a tight closing snap closure, multiple carrying handles, and steel eyes for fastening to the back of a quad track, the roof or an APC or stacking securely on a cargo deck. Assume it can carry 300 rounds of rifle ammo, or 500 rds of caseless ammo, 600 rds of pistol ammo or 200 rounds of shotgun ammo or two 100rd belts of rifle ammo.</p>
<p><strong>Yoshiko AD321 Floodlight</strong>: A portable LED floodlight mounted on a telescopic pole. The pole ends in four legs and can be pegged into the ground.
