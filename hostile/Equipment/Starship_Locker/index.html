<h2 id="descriptions">Descriptions</h2>
<p><strong>Advanced Motors Grab-Pad</strong>: The grab pad is analogous to a climber’s piton, protecting him from a fall by anchoring him to the rock face. A short metre-long tether connects the spacer’s belt to the grab pad, and this electro-adhesive pad adheres strongly to any metal surface once activated. It resembles a simple plate with a rugged handgrip. Electro-adhesive boots (known as ‘mag boots’) can fit hard suits. Cost $100. Mass 0.5kg.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Motors Unique Umbilical</strong>: Although many spacers carry out EVA’s using thruster packs disconnected from the spacecraft, it is often safer to use a length of umbilical. Gone are the days of a loose air pipe trailing in space. Each umbilical is a flexible pipe made up of 10m ball and socket links encased in a soft outer covering. A ratchet on the spacer’s belt enables him to apply immediate tension to the links, locking him in place at his worksite. Up to 10 umbilicals can be connected to create a single tether, 100m long. $1000. 5kg.</p>
<p><strong>Bintang MMU-6 Thruster Pack</strong>: Longer EVAs, or transfers between spacecraft, require a thruster pack. Most starships have one in their locker. The pack is a 30kg fuel and motor unit worn on the back, with control arms swinging around for use at the front of a user. A joystick on the right arm and a keypad on the left provide complete control. Once the desired orientation is achieved, the user can engage an automatic attitude-hold function that maintains the inertial position of the pack in flight. This frees both hands for work. The pack holds enough nitrogen gas fuel for approximately 6 hours of EVA, though this does not constitute continuous thrust. Delta-V is an impressive 25 metres per second. Cost is $2000, 30kg.</p>
<p><strong>Fisher AG7 Retractable Space-Pen</strong>: Unlike ordinary ballpoint pens, Fisher Space Pens have a pressurised refill that allows them to write upside down and at any angle and in extreme conditions, from -34°C up to 121° C. Not only can it write in zero-G, but it can even write over grease and underwater.</p>
<p><strong>Haruna Priority First Aid Kit</strong>: A small medical kit carried on a pouch that fits onto a rucksack or belt. It contains basic items, bandages, a pressure dressing, antibiotics, painkillers, eye-wash, antihistamines and plasters. It contains enough supplies for two wound treatments. Cost $50. Mass 0.5kg</p>
<p><strong>Kinako BB6 Basic Bubble</strong>: A large (2m diameter) pressurised and transparent plastic bubble. Piezoelectric layers in the bubble wall translate the user's movements into electricity to recharge the bubble's batteries and power its distress beacon. A small oxygen tank inflates the bubble and provides two-person/hours of life support. There is no airlock. Rescue bubbles can sometimes be found on space vessels and watercraft as emergency lifeboats. Cost $600. Mass 2 kg.</p>
<p><strong>McConnell 456 Soft Suit</strong>: The soft vacc suit can be used in a vacuum, but the air pressure must be reduced to prevent ballooning. This requires wearers to have spent some hours before the EVA pre-breathing oxygen. Because of this, hard suits are instead routinely used for work in a vacuum or near a vacuum. Soft suits, meanwhile, are used on planetary surfaces for protection against low pressures, radiation (decreasing exposure by up to 20 rads/hr), cold temperatures and unbreathable atmospheres. The suit has a duration of six hours. Cost $6,000. Mass 12 kg.</p>
<p><strong>Nortinghouse RS-5662 Thruster</strong>: For short duration EVAs, the handheld thruster is an invaluable and powerful tool that provides the spacer with a delta-V of 2 metres per second. It uses high-pressure cold gas (typically oxygen) as thrust, and being hand-held, it is highly versatile. The thruster costs $300 and has a mass of 2kg. It can sustain 15 minutes of flight.</p>
<p><strong>Reiner-Gama Orbital Tool Kit</strong>: The zero-G tool kit is essential for any repairs or construction work under-taken in zero gravity. It must be carried to the worksite, though hard suits can have such kits fitted as an optional extra. Tools in this kit are tailored for zero-G work; drills have counter-rotating heads to prevent torque from spinning the user around as a reaction. There are powered screwdrivers, wrenches, angle-grinders and saws, all battery-powered and benefitting from torque compensation. The basic portable kit costs Cr250 and masses 2kg. Costs $1000 and weighs 12kg.</p>
<p><strong>Rockford Aerospace Advanced Thruster Unit (ATU)</strong>: A gas-fueled thruster pack allows the user to manoeuvre in zero-gravity. A Vacc Suit skill check is required to use a thruster pack accurately. Thruster packs can only be used in zero-G environments and are only practical for journeys between spacecraft at the Adjacent range. Cost $2,000. Mass 5 kg.</p>
<p><strong>Safestar Type 1 Bio-Box</strong>: Some things need protecting from vacuum or hostile atmosphere, biological samples, delicate materials and even small animals (perhaps even pet cats and dogs). The Bio-Box is similar in size to a pet carrier but is pressurised and comes with a 6-hour air supply. Cost $450. Mass 2 kg.</p>
<p><strong>Tharsis A38 Hard Suit:</strong> The hard vacc suit is the spacer's best friend, providing life support and protection when in space. The suit provides a breathable atmosphere and protection from the extremes of temperature, low pressure and radiation typically found in a hard vacuum (decreasing exposure by up to 40 rads/hr) for six hours. Hard suits are rigid and have segmented joints for freedom of movement. They can operate at high pressures, so wearers do not need to pre-breathe oxygen before use. Cost $9,000. Mass 9 kg.</p>
<p><strong>Tharsis H200 Hostile Environment Suit</strong>: Hostile environment suits are designed for conditions where a normal vacc suit would be insufficient, such as deep underwater, worlds shrouded in toxic or corrosive gases, extremes of radiation or temperature, or other locales that offer serious physical danger as well as the lack of a breathable atmosphere. HEV suits provide all the life support of a normal vacc suit (for six hours). Still, they are also impervious to flames, intense radiation found at nuclear blast sites (decreasing radiation exposure by 90 rads/hr), and high-pressure environments like undersea trenches. Cost $18,000. Mass 40 kg.</p>
<p><strong>Tharsis M2 Ablative Canopy Orbital Re-entry (ACOR)</strong>: A personal re-entry kit allows a vacc- suited individual to enter a planetary atmosphere, survive, and parachute to the ground. This is a dangerous undertaking, usually practised by US Marines. ACOR packs are large and cumbersome, but the user can activate the system out of the airlock, inflating a 5m diameter ballute, with the user behind. The guidance computer and thruster unit which lay along the user's chest is now swung up, extended and activated. The descent begins with the ablative foam within the ballute sloughing off with the intense heat and friction. At an altitude of 15,000 feet, the main chute will deploy. The total time from orbit to touchdown is around 30-40 minutes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>ACOR: Surviving Re-entry</strong></p>
<p>ACOR users must make an Average (+0) Vacc Suit roll to make a successful re-entry. Apply the following DMs:</p>
<p>+1 Computer skill<br>
+1 Navigation skill<br>
+1 Pilot skill<br>
+2 Marine career<br>
+2 World Size 1<br>
+1 World size 2<br>
-2 Atmosphere B<br>
-4 Atmosphere C<br></p>
<p>Failure indicates being off course or landing in a dangerous situation. Success shows a perfect landing. A natural roll of ‘double 2’ means death or severe injury.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Yoshiko GP Surface Mask</strong>: A typical Off-World survival mask that can filter contaminants, taints smoke and dust (atmosphere types 4, 7, and 9) but can also compress breathed air to allow survival in a low-pressure atmosphere (types 2 and 3). Useful in Very Thin or Tainted atmospheres. Cost $150. Mass negligible.</p>
