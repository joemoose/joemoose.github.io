<h2 id="deacriptions">Deacriptions</h2>
<p><strong>Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitor</strong>: This vasodilator drug can be taken as a tablet and opens up the blood vessels giving a sudden rush of physical energy and a rapid high. The effect lasts for half an hour, giving the PC +1 on any physical action or social task. The side effect is a bout of nausea, dizziness (-2 all actions) lasting for an hour that takes effect instead of the high. If an Easy (+4) Endurance roll is then failed, the character also blacks out and suffers 1D6 damage. $100.</p>
<p><strong>Aspedine</strong>: Prevents intoxication via alcohol, useful on missions where social drinking must take place. After such a night, most people will be at-3 on all actions. Aspedine ensures a character stays fully alert. Cost $300.</p>
<p><strong>Benzoditropolene</strong>: This is a universal antitoxin effective against most poisons and nerve agents. On a 2D6 roll of 10+, it may even work against a more obscure poison. Works within one minute, arresting the poison's effects. Recovery then begins as usual. Cost $600.</p>
<p><strong>Betaseratonin ('Smart Drug')</strong>: This gives the user +1 on his technical or mental skills for 1-3 hours. The side effect is 'neuron misfire': the character is in a trance. Once a side effect is triggered, the character must make an Average Endurance roll to avoid having the side effect occur daily at random times (this random side effect is avoidable only if a dose of the smart drug is taken at the start of that day, i.e. It is very addictive!). Cost $400.</p>
<p><strong>Delta-14</strong>: Chemical warfare toxin causing 2D6 damage if an Average (0) Endurance roll iS made and causing death if failed. The time varies with the delivery method, but an aerosol delivery typically works within 1-3 combat rounds. $700.</p>
<p><strong>Dexamphetamine ('Speed' or 'Dex')</strong>: This amphetamine, a central nervous stimulant, provides a tremendous neuro-physical boost and comes as a small pink octagonal tablet. Gain +2 to carry out any act or task that does not require calm, careful concentration; this may include athletic moves, combat or kicking down a door. It lasts half an hour. No concentration is allowed. The side effect is 'high' that lasts only 5 minutes, followed by about of nervous exhaustion (all actions at a-2) for a couple of hours. Once a side effect is triggered, the character must make an Average Endurance roll to avoid having the side effect occur daily at random times (this random side effect is avoidable only if a dose of social drug iS taken at the start of that day). Cost $200</p>
<p><strong>Korteline</strong>: High energy drug allowing an 8-hour sleep period to be missed without the usual-3 penalty. A potential side effect is a deep depression (-1 all actions and an inability tO put oneself at risk) for 1D3 hours following that time. Cost $400.</p>
<p><strong>Lysophosphatidic Acid (LPA)</strong>: Must be administered before or immediately after (within ten minutes) suffering radiation exposure. It absorbs up to 100 rads per dose. A character may only use LPA once per day taking any more causes permanent Endurance damage of 1 point 1 per dose. Cost $300.</p>
<p><strong>Medical Drugs</strong></p>
<p>Three quality or rarity grades, 1, 2 &amp; 3, with prices of $200, $800 and $2,000 respectively. Each dose is carried within a vacuum-sealed phial packed into a foam-filled box that mounts six phials each.</p>
<ul>
<li>Aminoglycosides (antibiotic)</li>
<li>Antimetabolites (anti-cancer)</li>
<li>Cotrimoxozole (antibacterial)</li>
<li>Corticosteroids (immunosuppressants)</li>
<li>Cytotoxic Antibiotics (anti-cancer)</li>
<li>Idoxuridine (antiviral)</li>
<li>Sulphacetamide (antibacterial)</li>
<li>Sympathomimetic (neurotransmitter stimulant)</li>
<li>Synthetic Thyroxine (thyroid imbalances)</li>
<li>Tetracyclines (antibiotic)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pheromone-X ('Social Drug')</strong>: This is a mood relaxant that gives +1 to all social skills for 1-3 hours, those skills that generally involve personal interaction. The side effect is dulled senses and tiredness (-3 on all hearing and vision rolls). Once a side effect is triggered, the character must make an Average Endurance roll to avoid having the side effect occur daily at random times (this random side effect is avoidable only if a dose of the social drug is taken at the start of that day, i.e. It is very addictive!). $50.</p>
<p><strong>Polydichloric Euthimal ('PDE')</strong>: This mix of cocaine and meperidine is a central nervous drug that boosts physical performance. It gives the character +2 on any hand-to-hand combat and physical actions and cancels out all penalties from wounds sustained and potential unconsciousness. A character using the drug in combat adds +8 to his initiative total at the start of combat (or whenever the drug takes effect). The user becomes cold-blooded with no chance of success in his social skills. The side effect of PDE is catatonic fear, during which the character cowers in fear or behaves suicidally. The drug (or its side effect) lasts for one hour. Once a side effect is triggered, the character must make an Average Endurance roll to avoid having the side effect occur daily at random times (this random side effect is avoidable only if PDE is taken at the start of that day, i.e. It is very addictive!). Cost $500.</p>
<p><strong>Polypheronol-Z</strong>: A hallucinogenic drug that drowns the patient in pretty colours, emotional warmth and psychedelic trips. Haruna Biolabs created it in Chiba City to enable psycho-surgeons to unravel a patient's deep-rooted problems. Corporate snatch squads have recently used the drug as a truth serum. A single dose will result in one hour of 'truth' (often garbled with an awful lot of crap) as the patient talks in his post-hypnotic, auto-suggestive state of mind. This is followed by 1-6 hours of unconsciousness.  A dose of PPZ costs $800.</p>
<p><strong>Synthetic Endorphin Analog ('Endorphin', 'Dorph')</strong>: This pain inhibitor cancels any penalties suffered from wounds and shrugging of unconsciousness for up to 1 hour. It can be taken as a precaution. The 'dorph's' side effect is a one-hour nervous attack instead of the drug's effects. This gives the player character-1 on all physical actions. Once a side effect is triggered, the character must make an Average Endurance roll to avoid having the side effect occur daily at random times (this random side effect is avoidable only if a dose of endorphin is taken at the start of that day, i.e. It is very addictive!). Cost $300.</p>
<p><strong>Virax-B</strong>: A tranquilliser inducing paralysis. Victim rolls Average (0) Endurance or is paralysed in round for 2D6 minutes. A successful roll means instead slowness and clumsiness (-2 on actions) for 2D6 mins. Cost $200.</p>
