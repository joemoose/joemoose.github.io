<h3 id="autodoc">Autodoc</h3>
<p>An autodoc is a specialised, immobile medical robot that can be installed in a large vehicle or a spacecraft. The <strong>Haruna HN-500 Autodoc</strong> weighs 1000 kg and runs off the starship or building power supply, although in the event of a power failure contains 12 hours-worth of emergency battery power. The HN-500 is a sealed unit, lowering the chances of cross-infection, and it can be pressurised for use as a decompression chamber if required.</p>

<h3 id="mobile-sentry-robot">Mobile Sentry Robot</h3>
<p>The <strong>US M4 Trojan Mobile Sentry</strong> is a semi-autonomous armoured gun robot fitted with four rugged wheels and an armoured hull. A 9mmHE Hydra smart gun is mounted within an upper turret and 5,000 rounds of ammunition. The Trojan can be programmed to take on the monotonous task of perimeter surveillance and rapid-reaction, patrolling a set area, and firing on any target unable to show an IFF transponder. Or the gun drone' can be manually controlled via a ruggedised CMD ZX-22 that is supplied with the gun and can communicate with the M4 via radio-link. It also includes a hard-cased processor unit and integral turret-mounted sensors (an IFF system, camera, IR designator and IR thermography). The Trojan can also issue audio alarms and challenges to trespassers and has a turret-mounted floodlight for illumination. The M4 has a top speed of 20kph and an endurance of 12 hours using its fuel-cell powerplant. The MSR weighs 500kg and is roughly chest height.</p>

<h3 id="remote-sentry-robot">Remote Sentry Robot</h3>
<p>Sentry robots are designed to take on the monotonous task of static perimeter surveillance. The <strong>US M3A2 Spartan Remote Sentry Gun</strong> is
built around a belt-fed Steyr-Brandt StG 340 8.85mm light machine gun and includes a hard-cased processor unit, integral forward-facing sensors (an IFF system, camera,
IR designator and IR thermography) and is mounted via a motorised mount onto a rugged folding tripod. The weapon is supplied with 500 rounds. A CMD ZX-22 is provided with the gun and can communicate with the M3A2 via a radio link. It can be used to alter settings (such as burst control, scanning parameters, firing range, and to monitor both rounds used and the temperature of the barrel). The software alerts the user with a ‘critical’ alarm when only 50 rounds remain. The system has an operating range of 1,000m and weighs 70kg (sentry gun, tripod and portable terminal all included).</p>

<h3 id="farm-robot">Farm Robot</h3>
<p>A farming robot is used to tend crops on the surface of a planet. The Agri robot is the size of a ride-on lawnmower and has four rugged wheels for traction in soft soil. It carries a modular system at the rear, where hoppers of seed, fertiliser or pesticide can be swapped out as needed, or a plough, baler, scarifier, or other tools can be fitted. It is an automated mini-tractor useful for start-up colony worlds with a limited workforce. Several extendable farm tools are also mounted on the front. It cannot be used on starships, space station hydroponics, or greenhouse installations. The <strong>TDC Parkmaster 'Paco'</strong> is a typical example of this type of colony robot. The Parkmaster weighs 200 kg and is powered by a rechargeable lithium-ion battery allowing for continuous operation for 48 hours (recharging in 6 hours). It has a standard walking speed of 6m per round.\</p>

<h3 id="repair-robot">Repair Robot</h3>
<p>Shipboard repair robots are small machines that carry a variety of welding and cutting tools. The <strong>Tharsis PAK-3</strong> is a bi-pedal robot standing one meter tall with a forward-facing equipment bay from which tools can unfold. Its small size allows it to reach nearly all parts of a facility or starship. Magnetic induction coils in the feet will enable it to walk on the exterior of a spaceship. A folding wire cage on the back allows it to carry technical parts to and from the worksite. The PAK-3 weighs 155 kg and is powered by a rechargeable lithium-ion battery allowing for continuous operation for 24 hours (recharging in 4 hours). It has a standard walking speed of 3m per round.</p>

<h3 id="mining-drone">Mining Drone</h3>
<p>The <strong>Okuda-Hyundai HS900L Autonomous Excavator</strong> resembles a squat, cylindrical tunnelling machine on tracks; the HS900L mining drone can angle its rotating cutting head hydraulically. Cuttings are fed through the centre of the device and into a tracked cargo drone at the rear, which iS connected via a flexible sleeve. According to the situation, this cargo drone detaches when full and transfers its ore to a facility or mining ship. It can fill its 1-ton cargo drone with ore after 30 minutes of continuous drilling.</p>
<p>Mining drones are supplied in sets of three with a complete computer/ 1 command and control interface and dedicated drone bay (total cost $1M, total volume 10 tons). Off-road speed is 30kph; endurance is 5 hours.</p>

<h3 id="probe-drone">Probe Drone</h3>
<p>These survey space phenomena or planetary surfaces. Survey starships often carry a displacement ton of probe drones, equating to five individual drones. They can be dropped from orbit in disposable entry shells but must be recovered manually. Probe drones can also survey orbiting satellites, derelicts, and other space debris. They can also be used as communications relays. A single Aerodyne CLU Surveyor drone is 0.2 tons in volume and masses around 200 kg. The CLU is powered by a 100kW fuel cell and is equipped with a chemical rocket motor; it is equivalent to a small space probe of today, with a bank of cameras and sensors and a comms dish. For one month, the Aerodyne CLU can operate in space or on a planetary surface. Once landed, the probe is immobile, so care must be taken to select its landing site.</p>
