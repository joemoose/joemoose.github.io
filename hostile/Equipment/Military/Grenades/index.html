<h2 id="descriptions">Descriptions</h2>
<p><strong>M1 Smoke HC Grenade</strong>: The M1 smoke grenade creates a thick cloud of coloured smoke six metres in radius, centred on the location of the grenade. This smoke imposes a-2 DM on all attacks within or through the cloud (doubled for laser weapons). The smoke dissipates in 1D6x3 rounds, although high winds and other extreme weather can sharply reduce this time.</p>
<p><strong>M2 Riot Agent Grenade</strong>: The M2 riot agent grenade creates a cloud of fentanyl derivatives gas six metres in radius, centred on the location of the grenade. This fentanyl analogue will typically incapacitate anyone within the cloud that is not wearing breathing equipment. Victims must make a Very Difficult (-4) Endurance roll to avoid being knocked out for 1D6x10 minutes. Success means the victim suffers a-1 on all actions but is otherwise free to act. A roll of double-2 indicates serious injury. The victim suffers 2D6+2 damage. The gas will dissipate in 1D6x3 rounds, although high winds and other extreme weather can sharply reduce this time.</p>
<p><strong>M3 Stun Grenade</strong>: The M3 stun grenade is non-lethal and does not inflict typical damage. A character within six metres of a stun grenade detonation must make an Endurance check with a negative DM equal to the damage (after armour is subtracted). If this Endurance check is failed, the character is incapacitated for 1-3 rounds. If the Endurance check is successful, the character is unaffected by the weapon, and the stun damage is ignored.</p>
<p><strong>M4 Fragmentation Grenade</strong>: A core of high explosive is surrounded by a layer of notched wire which fragments on detonation. The damage from fragmentation grenades decreases with distance from the blast.</p>

<p><strong>M5 High Explosive Grenade</strong>: This is only available as a 30mm round for grenade launcher and cannot be hand thrown. The M5 HEAP (High Explosive Armor Piercing) grenade can penetrate light armour. It can inflict severe damage against lightly armoured and civilian vehicles and bunkers, buildings and fortifications. It will reduce the target's Armour points by ten and inflict 5D6 damage. It has a blast radius of 5m, and anybody within that radius will suffer 2D6 damage. Fired from the G6 Grenade Launcher, this grenade is laser targeted and will try to home in on any target designated by the firer using the G6's integral laser painter. This provides a +1 to hit.</p>
<p><strong>M6 Fragmentation Airburst Grenade</strong>:  This is only available as a 30mm round for a grenade launcher and cannot be hand thrown. The M6 has similar properties to the M4 Fragmentation grenade. Still, it can be commanded to detonate in the air a target once the firer has established range to the target using the G6's laser designator. This negates the defender's-2 for shooting from cover and negates hard and total cover for a character who considers himself safe.</p>
