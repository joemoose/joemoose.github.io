<p>Armour reduces the amount of damage a character takes from a hit, based on the type of worn armour. The <strong>Armour Rating (AR)</strong> for a set of armour equals the amount of damage reduced by the armour when you are hit in combat. A hit with <strong>Effect 6+</strong> always inflicts at least one point of damage, regardless of the target's armour. Unless otherwise noted, only one type of armour can be worn at a time.</p>
<h2 id="descriptions">Descriptions</h2>
<p><strong>Enforcer M21 Rigid Plated Armour</strong>:
Enforcer Armaments Corporation produces ERPA or rigid plated armour made of a composite alloy shell, mainly titanium aluminide alloy over a boron carbide layer, and a resin fixed to a carbon-fibre core. A Kevlar/ Salar woven liner rounds off the protection. It comes in the form of a helmet; a full-torso, clamshell-style, rigid body shell; and a set of lower leg guards. The Enforcer M34 Helmet features a microphone, tactical camera, slide down protective visor and an integral Zenith PRC-45 short-range radio. This is exclusively military or paramilitary.</p>
<p><strong>Hewison M5 Integrated Combat Suit</strong>: In environments where the warfighter requires complete environmental protection, Hewison Industries offers the M5 Integrated Combat Suit. This full-body suit protects from vacuum, high or low temperature, against biological or chemical agents, in unbreathable atmospheres and against radiation typically found in a hard vacuum (decreasing exposure by up to 40 rads/hr). It can support a soldier for six hours, much like a standard spacesuit, but the M5 is made of Kevlar and Salar woven layers sandwiching ceramic plates. Titanium-carbide plates reinforce vulnerable areas, and these rigid sections are backed by carbon fibre. The suit is coated with radar-absorbent neoprene polymer impregnated with conductive carbon black particles to reduce radar signature. The suit includes a Zenith PRC-45 radio, multi-beam flashlight, tethers and equipment pockets, TapTintâ„¢ anti-flash visor technology and thermal masking. This last feature provides the infantryman with a modicum of stealth against infra-red sensor devices: heat is sunk into a chill can, which must be replaced after one hour of use. The M5 is exclusively frontline military.</p>
<p><strong>McConnell 456 Soft Suit</strong>: The soft vacc suit can be used in a vacuum, but the air pressure must be reduced to prevent ballooning. This requires wearers to have spent some hours before the EVA pre-breathing oxygen. Because of this, hard suits are instead routinely used for work in a vacuum or near-vacuum. Soft suits, meanwhile, are used on planetary surfaces for protection against low pressures, radiation (decreasing exposure by up to 20 rads/hr), cold temperatures and unbreathable atmospheres. The suit has a duration of six hours.</p>
<p><strong>Stern B Ballistic Vest</strong>: This tactical vest protects the torso and is worn over clothing. Made of woven Salar and Kevlar ballistic cloths, the vest is suitable for protection against low-calibre rounds and high-velocity fragmentation with hardened lightweight K-type ceramic inserts. In a variety of colours or camo patterns. Includes lots of pockets for carrying ammo and equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Stern C Concealable Vest</strong>: A lightweight, soft ballistic vest for impact-resistant Salar and Kevlar fibres for the torso. The fabric absorbs impact energy and spreads it over the torso, resulting in bruising. It can be effectively concealed under regular clothing, although observers making an Int check at 8+ will notice something unusual.</p>
<p><strong>Tharsis A38 Hard Suit</strong>: The hard vacc suit is the spacer's best friend, providing life support and protection when in space. For six hours, the suit provides a breathable atmosphere and protection from the extremes of temperature, low pressure, and radiation typically found in a hard vacuum (decreasing exposure by up to 40 rads/hr). Hard suits are rigid and have segmented joints for freedom of movement; they can operate at high pressures, which means wearers do not need to pre-breathe oxygen before use.</p>
<p><strong>Tharsis H200 Hostile Environment Suit</strong>: Hostile environment suits are designed for conditions where a standard vacc suit would be insufficient, such as deep underwater, worlds shrouded in toxic or corrosive gases, extremes of radiation or temperature, or other locales that offer severe physical danger as well as the lack of a breathable atmosphere. HES suits provide all the life support provided by a standard vacc suit (for six hours) but are also impervious to flames, intense radiation such as that found at nuclear blast sites (decreasing radiation exposure by 90 rads/hr), and high-pressure environments like undersea trenches.</p>
