<h2 id="descriptions">Descriptions</h2>
<p><strong>Axe</strong>: A heavy axe used by fire-fighters, loggers, carpenters, expedition team members, etc.
It makes a devastating weapon but is not balanced for hand-to-hand fighting. The axe is one metre long.</p>
<p><strong>Club</strong>: A heavy stick used as a weapon. Easily obtained from standing trees or metal pipework, or any other long stick-shaped improvised weapon, including a long unloaded gun such as a rifle. A short club is anything up to 1m in length, while a long club is anything between 2 metres in length.</p>
<p><strong>Combat Knife</strong>: Typified by the Gerber Mark II, the combat knife is a lethal, serrated, two-edged fighting knife used by marines, soldiers and other military personnel. It makes a decent camp knife, too. It is approximately 200mm long and is generally carried in a sheath strapped on military shoulder webbing, on a belt or less frequently concealed in a boot sheath or strapped to the forearm. Combat knives are usually as a tool as a last resort weapon of defence and worn constantly. Each weighs 250 grams.</p>
<p><strong>Expedition Knife</strong>: A camping, hunting or survival knife used for skinning and butchering animals, setting up camp, simple woodcraft and survival activities. It comes with a sheath as well as a built-in compass and knife-sharpener. The knife is an able hand-to-had weapon. Length: 250mm.</p>
<p><strong>Folding Spade</strong>: The military folding spade or 'entrenching tool' has been used in many conflicts as a last resort weapon, from Julius Caesar's days to the Vietnam War. It is short, with a sharp cutting blade and can be wielded in hand-to-hand combat if no other weapon is at hand. The spade is 60 cm long but folds down to 24 cm and fits within a polymer carrier for mounting on a rucksack or belt.</p>
<p><strong>Machete</strong>: A large, heavy, single-edged knife used in cutting vegetation to clear a campsite. It can also be used as a large camp or field knife. It is generally carried in a belt sheath. Machetes are more survival tools than weapons and are often found in emergency kits, lifeboats etc.</p>
<p><strong>Spike</strong>: Any improvised weapon with a point or spike on end. A short spike is classed as anything up to 1 metre in length, while a long spike is any pointed improvised weapon between 1 and 3 metres in length.</p>
