<h2 id="automat-kaliningrad-akz-4">Automat Kaliningrad AKZ-4</h2>
<p>The Kalashnikov family of military rifles have a long pedigree and have been produced by various manufacturers over the years; from the AK-47, the AKM, the AK-74, the AK-100, 200 and 300 series, and finally the AKZs. The AKZ-4 is a rugged bullpup assault rifle with a magazine holding 30 x 6.50mm rifle rounds. A large selector allows single-shot, 4 round or 10 round bursts. It is essentially the same lightweight polymer rifle as the AK-340 but now chambered for the ubiquitous 6.50mm military rifle round. Rails for scopes and other attachments are fitted on the underside of the barrel and top of the receiver.</p>
<h2 id="enfield-l205-combat-rifle">Enfield L205 Combat Rifle</h2>
<p>The new British service rifle that uses the IS 8.85mm FSDS discarding sabot bullet. The UK employs dedicated squad grenadiers and so a grenade-launcher is not not fitted. Each weapon comes with an integral Aztec 2020M scope. Part of the L200 family.</p>
<h2 id="maverick-m24a1-rifle">Maverick M24A1 Rifle</h2>
<p>The M24A1 represents the cutting edge of American military firepower. It is an advanced assault rifle firing high-velocity 8.85mm FSDS discarding sabot bullets at 1200 metres per second. It uses an annular gas piston located around the barrel and a vertically moving bolt, making it possible to minimise the length of the receiver group and have a magazine located at the extreme rear of the weapon. A U-shaped rammer/extractor is used to chamber the caseless rounds by pushing them into the chamber. The rearward positioning of the magazine maximises the length of the barrel itself, improving both range and accuracy. Sighting is done with an integral AN/PVS-29 telescopic sight (4x magnification), which features hybrid IR and light-intensification imaging. Each caseless 5.60mm round is embedded deep within a polymer casing packed with consolidated propellant. The M24A1's electrical firing mechanism ignites this.</p>
<p>An M340 30mm grenade launcher is mounted under the barrel, and it utilises a high-low recoilminimising propulsion system. This launcher holds four grenades, and around is loaded into the breech, ready for launching by cycling a pump-action grip. A selector above the trigger allows the firer to choose between safety, single-shot, four-round or ten round bursts. It also has a setting for the grenade launcher, which means that the grenades are fired using the same trigger as the 8.85mm rounds. The launcher makes the rifle a little front-heavy, which has earned the rifle its nickname of 'the pig' amongst US troops. Marine veterans claim PIG stands for 'Piss-poor Infantry Gun' whilst others contend it stands for a 'Pain In-the-ass Gun'. Some show a preference for the M24A3 carbine.</p>
<h2 id="maverick-800-vector">Maverick 800 Vector</h2>
<p>With its mighty punch, accuracy and rugged construction, the Vector has found its way onto colony worlds, used by colonial forces and mercenaries across the Outer Veil. Although now looking dated, the rifle has been popular with the forces of some Earth nations and large stocks of the weapon are still available. The weapon includes in integral night-scope, a flashlight and fore-grip. The Vector can swap the fore-grip with a bipod, lose the flashlight and utilise a 32 round magazine for sustained fire use (adding 0.8kg to the weapon's weight).</p>
<h2 id="noricum-g2170-binary-propellant-rifle">Noricum G2170 Binary Propellant Rifle</h2>
<p>In an effort to increase the firepower of the modern combat rifle, Noricum experimented with binary propellant fuels in the late-22nd century. The G2170 was the result. It fires full-metal jacketed rounds just like conventional rifles, but does away with the propellant part of the cartridge. In effect there is no cartridge instead it uses two types of gases which are stable on their own, but are volatile when mixed together in the G2170's ignition chamber.</p>
<h2 id="sinqapore-arms-sa66">Sinqapore Arms SA66</h2>
<p>The Singapore Arms SA66 is a lightweight assault rifle firing the standard military 6.50mm rifle round. The gun is sold reasonably cheaply and found in service with a host of security forces and the armed forces of small nations. It is particularly popular with colonial forces and by colonists out on frontier worlds, who need a simple, lightweight but effective rifle to hand. It incorporates a carrying handle and a simple vacuformed clamshell body. Perhaps contributing to the weapon's popularity is its lightweight, reliability, and ease of use. On the downside, the recoil is quite harsh, making the gun hard to keep on target.</p>
