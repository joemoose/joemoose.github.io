<h2 id="singapoer-arms-sa7-survival-rifle">Singapoer Arms SA7 Survival Rifle</h2>
<p>The Singapore Arms SA7 is lightweight survival rifle firing the standard military 6.50mm rifle round. The gun is an adaptation of the SA66 assault rifle and is primarily used as a survival rifle, found on-board rovers and shuttles and in survival kits. It has a semi-automatic action and a simple vac formed clamshell body. Perhaps contributing to the weapon's popularity is its light weight, reliability and its ease of use.</p>
<h2 id="stern-universal-t51">Stern Universal T51</h2>
<p>This semi-automatic rifle fires one round for every trigger pull. It fires powerful 7.78 Ã— 52 bullets with some accuracy out to 1200m. The Universal T51 is popular with security sharpshooters, foresters and colonists who need a rifle for survival and hunting. A snug, form-fitting eight-shot magazine is inserted forward of the trigger assembly. Integral optical sights come as standard, but they can be removed. The entire rifle can be easily disassembled and stored within a purpose-made impact-resistant carry-box. The intention was for the gun to remain pristine when not used during activities in the colonies (bouncing around in ATVs or thrown in the back of a temporary pressurised base). This ability to break down the T51 has seen it gain some use with assassins out on the frontier.</p>
<h2 id="voroncovo-m33-coilgun">Voroncovo M33 Coilgun</h2>
<p>The Voroncovo corporation has introduced a new magnetic coil technology, bringing magnetic acceleration to the infantryman's battlefield. The coilgun is a large calibre sniper and anti-material rifle that accelerates ferrous rounds through electromagnetic coils powered by a high-energy liquid-metallic suspension battery. Discarding sabot rounds are loaded into the gun in a 10 round magazine to the rear of the trigger assembly. Each is a 12mm HVADS (High-Velocity Accelerated Discarding Sabot) given imparted spin using bias in the magnetic field. After leaving the barrel, the sabots fall away to reveal the 9.46mm teardrop-shaped bullet that consists of hardened steel, surrounded by a softer copper jacket with a hollow-point tip. The combination of high-velocity (upwards of 1400 metres per second), hollow-point tip and dense core give the round superb stopping power and an effective armour-piercing capability. The limit on coil gun technology is the dependence on a high-energy power source, and so the M33 is a precision sniper rifle and not a weapon that will not be firing hundreds of rounds a minute.</p>
