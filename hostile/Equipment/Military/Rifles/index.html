<h2 id="descriptions">Descriptions</h2>
<p><strong>Automat Kaliningrad AKZ-4 [6.50mm]</strong>: The Kalashnikov family of military rifles have a long pedigree and have been produced by various manufacturers over the years; from the AK-47, the AKM, the AK-74, the AK-100, 200 and 300 series, and finally the AKZs. The AKZ-4 is a rugged bullpup assault rifle with a magazine holding 30 x 6.50mm rifle rounds. A large selector allows single-shot, 4 round or 10 round bursts. It is essentially the same lightweight polymer rifle as the AK-340 but now chambered for the ubiquitous 6.50mm military rifle round. Rails for scopes and other attachments are fitted on the underside of the barrel and top of the receiver.</p>
<p><strong>Maverick M24A1 ACR [8.85mmCL]</strong>: The M24A1 represents the cutting edge of American military firepower. It is an advanced assault rifle firing high-velocity 8.85mm FSDS discarding sabot bullets at 1200 metres per second. It uses an annular gas piston located around the barrel and a vertically moving bolt, making it possible to minimise the length of the receiver group and have a magazine located at the extreme rear of the weapon. A U-shaped rammer/extractor is used to chamber the caseless rounds by pushing them into the chamber. The rearward positioning of the magazine maximises the length of the barrel itself, improving both range and accuracy. Sighting is done with an integral AN/PVS-29 telescopic sight (4x magnification), which features hybrid IR and light-intensification imaging. Each caseless 5.60mm round is embedded deep within a polymer casing packed with consolidated propellant. The M24A1's electrical firing mechanism ignites this.</p>
<p>An M340 30mm grenade launcher is mounted under the barrel, and it utilises a high-low recoilminimising propulsion system. This launcher holds four grenades, and around is loaded into the breech, ready for launching by cycling a pump-action grip. A selector above the trigger allows the firer to choose between safety, single-shot, four-round or ten round bursts. It also has a setting for the grenade launcher, which means that the grenades are fired using the same trigger as the 8.85mm rounds. The launcher makes the rifle a little front-heavy, which has earned the rifle its nickname of 'the pig' amongst US troops. Marine veterans claim PIG stands for 'Piss-poor Infantry Gun' whilst others contend it stands for a 'Pain In-the-ass Gun'. Some show a preference for the M24A3 carbine.</p>
<p><strong>Maverick M24A3 Carbine [8.85mmCL]</strong>: The M24A3 is a shortened carbine version of the standard M24A1 advanced combat rifle. It is an advanced carbine firing high-velocity 8.85mm FSDS discarding sabot bullets at 1200 metres per second. It uses an annular gas piston located around the barrel and a vertically moving bolt, making it possible to minimise the length of the receiver group and have I magazine located at the extreme rear of the weapon. A U-shaped rammer/extractor is used to chamber the caseless rounds by pushing them into the chamber. The rearward positioning of the magazine maximises the length of the barrel itself, improving both range and accuracy. Sighting is done with an integral AN/PVS-29 telescopic sight (4x magnification), which features hybrid IR and light-intensification imaging. Each caseless 5.60mm round is embedded deep within a polymer casing packed with consolidated propellant ignited by the M24's electrical firing mechanism.</p>
<p>This version is used by jump-jet and armoured vehicle crews who appreciate its compact design, as well as by police forces, private military contractors and rear-echelon troops (signallers, drivers and mine-clearance troops, etc.), Dispensing with the M340 grenade launcher, the carbine much lighter and it features a much shorter barrel. Due to this shortened barrel, it is less accurate and less powerful, especially at long ranges. The lighter weight also increases the recoil, despite the weapon's internal compensation.</p>
<p><strong>Singapore Arms SA66 [6.50mm]</strong>: The Singapore Arms SA66 is a lightweight assault rifle firing the standard military 6.50mm rifle round. The gun is sold reasonably cheaply and found in service with a host of security forces and the armed forces of small nations. It is particularly popular with colonial forces and by colonists out on frontier worlds, who need a simple, lightweight but effective rifle to hand. It incorporates a carrying handle and a simple vacuformed clamshell body. Perhaps contributing to the weapon's popularity is its lightweight, reliability, and ease of use. On the downside, the recoil is quite harsh, making the gun hard to keep on target.</p>
<p><strong>Stern Universal T51 Rifle [7.78mm]</strong>: This semi-automatic rifle fires one round for every trigger pull. It fires powerful 7.78 × 52 bullets with some accuracy out to 1200m. The Universal T51 is popular with security sharpshooters, foresters and colonists who need a rifle for survival and hunting. A snug, form-fitting eight-shot magazine is inserted forward of the trigger assembly. Integral optical sights come as standard, but they can be removed. The entire rifle can be easily disassembled and stored within a purpose-made impact-resistant carry-box. The intention was for the gun to remain pristine when not used during activities in the colonies (bouncing around in ATVs or thrown in the back of a temporary pressurised base). This ability to break down the T51 has seen it gain some use with assassins out on the frontier.</p>
<p><strong>Voroncovo M33 Coilgun [12mm HVADS]</strong>: The Voroncovo corporation has introduced a new magnetic coil technology, bringing magnetic acceleration to the infantryman's battlefield. The coilgun is a large calibre sniper and anti-material rifle that accelerates ferrous rounds through electromagnetic coils powered by a high-energy liquid-metallic suspension battery. Discarding sabot rounds are loaded into the gun in a 10 round magazine to the rear of the trigger assembly. Each is a 12mm HVADS (High-Velocity Accelerated Discarding Sabot) given imparted spin using bias in the magnetic field. After leaving the barrel, the sabots fall away to reveal the 9.46mm teardrop-shaped bullet that consists of hardened steel, surrounded by a softer copper jacket with a hollow-point tip. The combination of high-velocity (upwards of 1400 metres per second), hollow-point tip and dense core give the round superb stopping power and an effective armour-piercing capability. The limit on coil gun technology is the dependence on a high-energy power source, and so the M33 is a precision sniper rifle and not a weapon that will not be firing hundreds of rounds a minute.</p>
<p><strong>Zenith M1000 30MW Combat Laser</strong>: Zenith is renowned for its optics and range of laser weapons. The M1000 is the lightest and most portable of all of its firearms. On a trigger pull, the liquid metallic suspension battery charges a fast-discharge generator which briefly stores then releases that energy as a pulse. The high energy, short-duration beam causes instantaneous and extreme temperature change in a target's surface, causing vaporisation and thermal shock. The rifle is used for precision sniper attacks at extremely long-range, and to target this long-range weapon Zenith have fitted a sophisticated, gyro-stabilised electronic sighting system. The battery slots into the underside of the stock. A bipod is fitted.</p>
