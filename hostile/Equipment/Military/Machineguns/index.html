<h2 id="asa-m3-hydra-imag">ASA M3 Hydra IMAG</h2>
<p>ASA M3 Hydra IMAG [Intelligent Machinegun Auto-Guiding] A light machinegun attached to steady-mount and operator's harness. The operator can aim the gun through 180 degrees, squeezing the calliper-like trigger to fire the weapon. The Hydra will self-steer the barrel under the operator's guidance, making the system accurate (+1 to all attacks). Tracking is via both a motion tracker and an infra-red sensor mounted above and below the barrel that sends target images to the user's smart goggles connected to the gun via cable and jack.</p>
<p>Supplied by an ammunition drum holding 250 rounds of 9x28mm caseless, the IMAG Hydra is used to provide suppressive fire, to deal with armoured troops, equipment, and soft-skinned vehicles. It does this with a slightly larger and more powerful round than used in the M24 series of rifles. The 9x28mm round is designated as HE (high explosive), giving the squad a real punch.</p>
<h2 id="herstal-nationale-hn141-heavy-machine-gun">Herstal-Nationale HN141 Heavy Machine Gun</h2>
<p>Herstal-Nationale, a European tools and firearms manufacturer, designed the famous HN141 almost a hundred years ago. Adopted by many militaries, including China, Japan and the US (as the M6 HMG), it is in still in service today, though mainly used on vehicles. Lighter coilguns look set to replace it. It feeds from a side-hopper that holds a single 200-round ammunition belt.</p>
<h2 id="maverick-m68-lmg">Maverick M68 LMG</h2>
<p>The M68 is a light machinegun variant of the standard M24A1 advanced combat rifle. The M68 is fitted with a longer and heavier barrel that can cope with sustained burst fire without overheating to fulfil its role as a squad support weapon. In addition, the grenade launcher has been dropped in favour of a folding bipod, used to support the gun as it provides covering fire for the rest of the squad during fire and movement operations. Like the M24A1, the M68 fires high velocity 8.85mm FSDS discarding sabot bullets at 1200 metres per second. It uses an annular gas piston located around the barrel and a vertically moving bolt, making it possible to minimise the length of the receiver group and have a magazine located at the extreme rear of the weapon.</p>
<p>A U-shaped rammer/extractor is used to chamber the caseless rounds by pushing them into the chamber. The rearward positioning of the magazine maximises the length of the barrel itself, improving both range and accuracy. Sighting is done with an integral AN/PVS-29 telescopic sight (4x magnification), which features hybrid IR and light-intensification imaging. Each caseless 5.60mm round is embedded deep within a polymer casing (of 8.85mm calibre) packed with consolidated propellant ignited by the M68's electrical firing mechanism. The barrel is fitted with a flash suppressor to minimise the gun's signature when under observation from hostile forces.</p>
<h2 id="steyr-brandt-stg-340">Steyr-Brandt StG 340</h2>
<p>The Steyr-Brandt StG 340 is a heavy assault rifle used either as a light machinegun or with the bipod removed and the ammo hopper swapped for a 30 round box magazine, like an assault rifle. Quick conversion to a rifle lightens the gun to 4kg. The StG 340 fires the modern high-velocity 8.85mm discarding sabot bullet at 1200 metres per second. Each caseless 5.60mm sabot round is embedded deep within a polymer casing (of 8.85mm calibre) packed with consolidated propellant and ignited by the Steyr's electrical firing mechanism. S The 340 is used by several armies, including Germany, Great Britain and Brazil.</p>
<h2 id="voroncovo-m5a5-auto-coilgun">Voroncovo M5A5 Auto Coilgun</h2>
<p>A development of the M33 sniper coil gun, the Auto Coilgun is a heavy machinegun used in anti-aircraft defence as an auxiliary weapon on many types of military vehicles. The weapon overcomes the power dependencies of the M33 by relying on the powerplant of its host vehicle. Auto Coilguns can also be mounted onto a tripod (mass 15kg) as an infantry support gun, and these are supplied with an M2 CAPSU (Combined Ammunition and Power Supply Unit). Like the M33, the fully automatic M5A5 accelerates ferrous rounds through electromagnetic coils powered by a high-energy liquid-metallic suspension battery. The 12mm rounds are loaded into the gun via a flexible ammunition belt that feeds from a side-mounted hopper. The high velocities attained by the coilgun produce flat and very accurate trajectories. The weapon can use various types of ammunition.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HVADS</strong> (High-Velocity Accelerated Discarding Sabot): Anti-personnel</li>
<li><strong>HVAAP</strong> (High-Velocity Accelerated Armour Piercing): Anti-vehicle (ignore 8 pts of armour)</li>
<li><strong>HVAAP-I</strong> (High-Velocity Accelerated Armour Piercing-Incendiary): Anti-vehicle (ignore 10 pts of armour)</li>
</ul>
