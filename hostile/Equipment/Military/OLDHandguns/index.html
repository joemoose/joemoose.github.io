<h2 id="descriptions">Descriptions</h2>
<p><strong>ASA Taurus Auto [7.65mm]</strong>: Firing a lightweight 7.65x17 Browning round with relatively low recoil, the ASA Taurus is capable â€¢ not just of 4-round bursts but of sustained 10-round bursts. This advantage has seen the gun accepted by many police and security forces.</p>
<p><strong>Noricum M44 Revolver [.44 Mag]</strong>: The Model 44 may look retro, but it is a cutting edge design. Yes, it is a revolver, but it is incredibly reliable, and a misfire can be ignored with another pull of the trigger. The Model 44 fires a .44 Magnum round, one of the biggest of the handgun calibres. It features custom amber grips and in-built red-dot laser sight and range-finder. An LED on top of the frame provides range indication through colour change.</p>
<p><strong>Stern Weapons VP90 [10mm Corta]</strong>: The VP90 is a reliable 10mm machine pistol that has been re-designed and re-engineered many times over the past fifty years, but the design is a strong one. Its reliability and accuracy have never been bettered and used as a US Marine sidearm and close protection firearm for security troops throughout human-explored space. It features a double-column in the magazine (to cram in 10 x 22mm Corta bullets) and a high-impact plastic receiver.</p>
<p><strong>Williams Auto Redhawk Model 4 [10mm Corta]</strong>: The Williams Auto Redhawk Model 4 is one of the most popular auto pistols. Capable of single-shot, it also has a burst-fire option for more accurate fire. The 10x22m Corta rounds have a lethality that security forces and police units appreciate across human space, but the round is still just about manageable in burst mode. Of course, auto fire in a weapon this size requires some skill. Williams Arms recommend a two-handed hold on the gun. A later development, the Model 5, was designed to improve the otherwise lacklustre accuracy of the Model 4.</p>
<p><strong>Williams Auto Redhawk Model 5 [10mm Corta]</strong>: The Williams Auto Redhawk Model 5, like the Model 4, is one of the most popular auto pistols in use today. It is capable of single-shot and has a burst-fire option for more accurate fire. The 10x22m Corta rounds have lethality that is appreciated by security forces and police units across human space, but the round is still just about manageable in burst mode. The Model 5 features a 2cm extension to the barrel and a revised front sight in the form of a front post in a hooded ring. The Model 5 was designed to improve the otherwise lacklustre accuracy of the Model 4.</p>
<p><strong>Williams Model 9 Stun Gun</strong>: Twenty-third-century stun guns use focused sonic waves to disorientate and incapacitate their victims. They are a non-lethal alternative to handguns, easy to handle with no recoil, but useful only at short range. When hit by the Stun Gun, a target makes an End roll with a DM penalty equal to the damage rolled. Subtract armour from this damage. If failed, the target is unconscious for 1D6 minutes. If successful, then the target takes an a-1 penalty to his actions for 1D6 minutes but is otherwise free to act.</p>
