<h2 id="asa-taurus-auto">ASA Taurus Auto</h2>
<p>Firing a lightweight 7.65x17 Browning round with relatively low recoil, the ASA Taurus is capable â€¢ not just of 4-round bursts but of sustained 10-round bursts. This advantage has seen the gun accepted by many police and security forces.</p>
<h2 id="chulai-type-56-pistol">Chulai Type 56 Pistol</h2>
<p>Manufactured by Chulai, a Chinese arms company, the Type 56 saw extensive export throughout the Asia Pacific Partnership as a 'man-stopper', popular with police and security forces. t includes an integral laser sight. The Chulai Type 56 was initially chambered in China's popular 5.8mm armour-piercing round, but export versions were rechambered for the .44, which is more common.</p>
<h2 id="mcconnell-zero-5-gyrojet-pistol">McConnell Zero-5 Gyrojet Pistol</h2>
<p>The McConnell Zero-5 is gyrojet pistol without recoil that has been designed exclusively for personnel wearing vacuum suits. With its lack of trigger guard and easy of access to the trigger, coupled with a lack of recoil (a significant hazard in low or zero-G environments). the Zero-5 found a ready market on the Frontier. To prevent accidental lo discharge, the weapon has a thumb safety at the rear of the receiver. Both must be pressed to fire the weapon. Aiming is done purely using the laser sight mounted beneath the barrel. There are no iron sights or fittings for scopes.</p>
<p>The Zero-5 fires 10mm solid-fuel rocket rounds, each round has four pinhole-sized nozzles angled to simulate rifling, and it burns for 5 metres before momentum takes over. Ammunition types vary, but the most common ammunition load is KEAP (kinetic energy armor piercing). which can penetrate heavy-duty vac suits and hostile environment suiis. The Omm Gyro rounds include t dense tungsten core penetrator and are Teflon coated, which prevents the round from deforming as it strikes a hard or resilient material.</p>
<h2 id="stern-weapons-vp90">Stern Weapons VP90</h2>
<p>The VP90 is a reliable 10mm machine pistol that has been re-designed and re-engineered many times over the past fifty years, but the design is a strong one. Its reliability and accuracy have never been bettered and used as a US Marine sidearm and close protection firearm for security troops throughout human-explored space. It features a double-column in the magazine (to cram in 10 x 22mm Corta bullets) and a high-impact plastic receiver.</p>
<h2 id="williams-auto-redhawk-model-4">Williams Auto Redhawk Model 4</h2>
<p>The Williams Auto Redhawk Model 4 is one of the most popular auto pistols. Capable of single-shot, it also has a burst-fire option for more accurate fire. The 10x22m Corta rounds have a lethality that security forces and police units appreciate across human space, but the round is still just about manageable in burst mode. Of course, auto fire in a weapon this size requires some skill. Williams Arms recommend a two-handed hold on the gun. A later development, the Model 5, was designed to improve the otherwise lacklustre accuracy of the Model 4.</p>
<h2 id="williams-auto-redhawk-model-5">Williams Auto Redhawk Model 5</h2>
<p>The Williams Auto Redhawk Model 5, like the Model 4, is one of the most popular auto pistols in use today. It is capable of single-shot and has a burst-fire option for more accurate fire. The 10x22m Corta rounds have lethality that is appreciated by security forces and police units across human space, but the round is still just about manageable in burst mode. The Model 5 features a 2cm extension to the barrel and a revised front sight in the form of a front post in a hooded ring. The Model 5 was designed to improve the otherwise lacklustre accuracy of the Model 4.</p>
<h2 id="williams-model-9-stun-gun">Williams Model 9 Stun Gun</h2>
<p>Twenty-third-century stun guns use focused sonic waves to disorientate and incapacitate their victims. They are a non-lethal alternative to handguns, easy to handle with no recoil, but useful only at short range. When hit by the Stun Gun, a target makes an End roll with a DM penalty equal to the damage rolled. Subtract armour from this damage. If failed, the target is unconscious for 1D6 minutes. If successful, then the target takes an a-1 penalty to his actions for 1D6 minutes but is otherwise free to act.</p>
