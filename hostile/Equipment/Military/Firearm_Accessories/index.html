<h2 id="inferno-electronics-500-powerscope">Inferno Electronics 500 Powerscope</h2>
<p>High-quality telescopic sights with image intensification and low-light capabilities for night-shooting. These are attached to the upper surface of firearms in order to increase their accuracy, especially at longer ranges. A weapon equipped with such sights gains an extra +1 DM bonus to any attack that has been aimed. Scopes are delicate, however, and maybe jarred out of alignment by any violent action (such as being left untended in a moving truck, close explosion, or being dropped) on an 8+ on 2D6. When the sights go out of adjustment, the firer will always miss. Some guns already come with integrated scopes; see the individual descriptions. Cost $1000. Mass 0.8kg.</p>
<h2 id="inferno-electronics-800-toughscope">Inferno Electronics 800 Toughscope</h2>
<p>A rugged version of the Inferno Electronics 500 sights used in hostile atmospheres, vacuum, and extreme temperatures. They are almost unbreakable. Cost $2500. Mass 1.2kg.</p>
<h2 id="kinako-survival-bag-n401">Kinako Survival Bag N401</h2>
<p>Lightweight, tough polyethene survival bag is essential equipment for every hiker. Use for shelter in an emergency or for keeping you dry during a heavy rainstorm. It can also be used as a waterproof stash for your kit, storing muddy clothes and boots in a cramped tent or as a body bag.</p>
<h2 id="magtech-fs100-frame-stock">Magtech FS100 Frame-Stock</h2>
<p>Pistols and revolvers may be turned into light carbines by the attachment of wire-framed folding shoulder stock. The range is increased to the 'assault' range band, although the weapon can no longer be holstered. The pistol's overall length is increased by the length of the stock, although this can be folded if required. Attaching or detaching the stock takes combat rounds. Cost $75. Mass 0.8kg.</p>
<h2 id="magtech-universal-care-kit">Magtech Universal Care Kit</h2>
<p>A set of cleaning rods, brushes and disassembly tools for many types of rifle, pistol SMG and shotgun. Packed into a slim-line waterproof pouch along with a set of lubricant bottles. Cost $100. Mass 0.25kg.</p>
<h2 id="miyagi-hi-capacity-drum-series-3">Miyagi Hi-Capacity Drum Series 3</h2>
<p>With the advent and popularity of fully automatic firing pistols like the VP-90 and the Williams Redhawk, an aftermarket add-on, the snail-drum has become available. This bulky and heavy ammo drum sits below the gun's handgrip and holds 45 rounds. The weapon can no longer be holstered and remains clumsy and awkward to use. Cost $130, Mass 1kg (loaded).</p>
<h2 id="nickelback-frontier-cartridge-belt">Nickelback Frontier Cartridge Belt</h2>
<p>A leather or nylon belt fitted with cartridge loops designed to hold 6 propelled grenades, eight individual shotgun cartridges, 20 pistol rounds or 14 rifle rounds. A different holder must be purchased for each ammunition type. Cost $5. Mass negligible.</p>
<h2 id="noricum-railrider-30gl">Noricum Railrider 30GL</h2>
<p>An underslung 30mm grenade launcher can be added to any rifle. This grenade launcher has a magazine of one grenade, cannot fire on automatic and takes four minor actions to reload. Cost $1000. Mass 1kg.</p>
<h2 id="novomo-crux-bipod">Novomo Crux Bipod</h2>
<p>Although some weapons boast integral bipods, firearms sold without such accessories may also be fitted with them. A bipod will only benefit a long weapon such as the Stern Universal T51 rifle or Maverick 800 Vector assault rifle. A bipod lowers the recoil by 2 points and makes firing from a prone position for long periods more comfortable. Cost $75. Mass 0.8kg.</p>
<h2 id="okuda-hr1-terminal-spot-laser">Okuda HR1 Terminal Spot Laser</h2>
<p>Integrated optics and red-dot laser sights give an extra +1 DM bonus to any attack that has been aimed. Cost $200. Mass 1.5kg.</p>
<h2 id="overshot-tac-100">Overshot Tac-100</h2>
<p>Purpose-built flashlight attaching to a gun barrel's top, side, or underside. The flashlight is activated via a button on the flashlight itself.</p>
<h2 id="stern-pa58-hard-case">Stern PA58 Hard Case</h2>
<p>Tough steel cargo case (32x20x22cm) perfect for carrying ammunition, equipment or supplies. It features a waterproof rubber seal and a tight closing snap closure, multiple carrying handles, and steel eyes for fastening to the back of a quad track, the roof or an APC or stacking securely on a cargo deck. Assume it can carry 300 rounds of rifle ammo, or 500 rds of caseless ammo, 600 rds of pistol ammo or 200 rounds of shotgun ammo or two 100rd belts of rifle ammo.</p>
<h2 id="steyr-grand-ace-speedloader">Steyr Grand Ace Speedloader</h2>
<p>The speedloader is a preloaded frame of six revolver rounds that can be used to load all six chambers of a revolver simultaneously. The firer may have several speedloaders as part of his equipment to speed the reloading of his revolver. Reloading with a speedloader requires one minor action. Cost $10. Mass 0.12kg (loaded).</p>
<h2 id="voroncovo-kl-suppressor">Voroncovo KL Suppressor</h2>
<p>A suppressor can be added to any non-energy weapon with a ROF of 4 or less, partially masking the sound produced by firing (-4 DM to detect). Cost $300. Mass negligible.</p>
