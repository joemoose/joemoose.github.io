<h2 id="descriptions">Descriptions</h2>
<p><strong>ASA Hoplite Combat Shotgun [12 gauge]</strong>: The Hoplite is touted as a fully automatic shotgun, capable of firing 4 round bursts, but such short-range, indiscriminate firepower has little use other than in gang warfare. The weapon is often purchased for its handy bullpup layout, smooth semi-auto (one shot per pull of the trigger) action and accessory rail above the barrel for laser sights, torches, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Noricum 37 Stakeout [12 gauge]</strong>: The Noricum is 37 is based on a 1946 design; it has proven itself for more than two centuries as a workhorse shotgun of worldwide police forces and security companies, and military units. It is, in essence, the bare bones of what a shotgun needs to be, cutting everything down in size to create a convenient and easily used weapon in buildings, streets, jungles, starship corridors and mining installations. No wonder it is a favourite of the US Colonial Marshals. The gun is pump-action and includes a folding stock. It is capable of being concealed under long, loose clothing. A tubular magazine inserted beneath the barrel holds four shells.</p>
<p><strong>Stern Weapons 2000 Shotgun [12 gauge]</strong>: Stern has been producing shotguns for over two hundred years, and 2000 is a design that has changed in little in that time. It is semi-automatic (one shot per pull of the trigger) rather than a pump action. It is sold for use on colony outposts and starships in a 'personal defence' layout [the stock is removed and the barrel shortened drastically]. A tubular magazine inserted beneath the barrel holds five shells.</p>
