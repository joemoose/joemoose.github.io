<h1 id="vacc-suits">Vacc Suits</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The spacesuit is more important to you than any mere piece of clothing. You spend hours in it every week, and some people spend most of their working day inside a suit. Your suit is personal, customised to the way you work. Colloquially, they are known as vacc suits (from everyday use in outer space vacuum'). Still, these suits can operate almost anywhere, from dusty, rocky surfaces within poisonous toxic atmospheres to frozen moons with icy methane atmospheres and other hostile places.</p>
<p>Vacc suits are complex. Each is a self-contained space vehicle in its own right, with a breathable atmosphere, pressure regulation, heating and cooling controls, drinking water, 10 km radio and TV camera communications, a 5m range flashlight, limited micrometeoroid and radiation protection and the ability to do all that in a low-pressure environment that threatens to turn your suit into a balloon.</p>
<p>Hard-working spacers can order custom suits that fit their exacting needs. </p>
<h2 id="action-penalties">Action Penalties</h2>
<p>Suits are bulky and constraining. All suits begin with a basic penalty to all physical actions taken while in the suit. Added extras further increase general encumbrance and can further increase this action penalty. Training and experience count for a lot, though. Of course, the wearer's Vacc Suit skill will negate these penalty DMs if it is of a high enough level.</p>
<h2 id="whats-in-a-suit">What's in a Suit?</h2>
<p>Standard kits include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Radio (10 km range)</li>
<li>Radio Headset</li>
<li>Drinking-Water (1-2 litres)</li>
<li>TV Camera</li>
<li>Worklight (5m range)</li>
<li>Loops and carabiners for equipment</li>
<li>Suit repair kit (for one large breach)</li>
<li>PLSS recharge connector</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="basic-models">Basic Models</h2>
<p>There are four basic models: Soft Suits, Mining suits, HArd Suits, and Hostile Environment Suits (HES).</p>
<p>Custom suits can also be made to specific specifications.</p>
<h3 id="soft-suit">Soft Suit</h3>
<p>This suit can be used in a vacuum, but to prevent ballooning, the air pressure must be reduced and requires wearers to have spent some hours before the EVA pre-breathing oxygen. Because of this, hard suits are instead routinely used for work in a vacuum or near-vacuum. Soft suits are better suited for use on planetary surfaces for protection against low pressures, radiation (decreasing exposure by up to 20 rads/hr), cold temperatures and unbreathable atmospheres.</p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong> $6,000. <strong>Weight</strong> 12 kg. <strong>Armour Rating</strong> 4, <strong>Action Penalty</strong> -1. <strong>Duration</strong> 6 hours.</p>
<h3 id="mining-suit">Mining Suit</h3>
<p>Used by miners or others working in hazardous conditions, this suit is a customised semihard suit with a rigid torso. It includes armoured protection against accidental impacts, tears and punctures. It is well-designed for hard, physical labour and includes advanced temperature control, climbing harness, flashlights and rad counter. The suit can be used in a vacuum, just like soft suits, but the air pressure must be reduced to prevent ballooning. This requires wearers to have spent some hours before the EVA pre-breathing oxygen.</p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong> $9,650. <strong>Weight</strong> 9 kg. <strong>Armour</strong> <strong>Rating</strong> 6. <strong>Action</strong> <strong>Penalty</strong> -1. <strong>Duration</strong> 6 hours.</p>
<h3 id="hard-suit">Hard Suit</h3>
<p>The hard vacc suit is the spacer's best friend, providing life support and protection when in space. The suit provides a breathable atmosphere and protection from the extremes of temperature, low pressure and radiation typically found in a hard vacuum (decreasing exposure by up to 40 rads/hr) for six hours. Hard suits are rigid and have segmented joints for freedom of movement. They can operate at high pressures, so wearers do not need to pre-breathe oxygen before use.</p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong> $9,000. <strong>Weight</strong> 9 kg. <strong>Armour</strong> <strong>Rating</strong> 6. <strong>Action</strong> <strong>Penalty</strong> -2. <strong>Duration</strong> 6 hours.</p>
<h3 id="hostile-environment-suit">Hostile Environment Suit</h3>
<p>Hostile environment suits are designed for conditions where a typical vacc suit would be insufficient, such as deep underwater, corrosive gases, or extreme radiation or temperature. HES suits provide all the life support offered by a typical vacc suit but are also impervious to flames, intense radiation, and high-pressure environments like undersea trenches. Includes a radiation and toxic gas analyser.</p>

<h2 id="hostile-environment-suits">Hostile Environment Suits</h2>
<p>Most vacc suits can cope with vacuum and temperatures from 120°C down to-180°C. There are more hostile environments: the Jovian moons are bathed in radiation, Mercury's dayside surface is a boiling 427°C, and on Venus, a visitor suffers the heat of Mercury with the added peril of being crushed by 92 atmospheres!</p>
<p>The Tharsis H200 (HES) is an armoured and powered exo-suit with heat-shielding and advanced radiation protection. The visor can screen out UV radiation and allow vision even on near-star worlds. Finally, the suit is resistant to flame and extremely toxic atmospheres.</p>
<p>Unlike the other vacc suits, it includes a radiation and toxic gas analyser and a thruster pack for manoeuvring in zero-G or underwater. It is built to withstand tremendous pressure from either alien atmospheres or ocean depths. Since it can maintain an Earth-like internal atmosphere, there is never any need for decompression.</p>
<h2 id="life-inside-your-suit">Life Inside Your Suit</h2>
<p>It goes without saying that a vacc suit can be bulky and uncomfortable, but there are some comforts. A full-body garment iS worn beneath the suit includes a water-cooled layer. Still, warm water can instead be sent through the system as the suit detects a change in the outside temperature. Drinking water, typically a litre or two, is included, and a drinking tube is fixed close to the wearer's mouth. They can also mount a food stick into a nearby housing, giving the wearer a chance to eat something if in the suit for several hours. Urine iS processed in thigh pockets and sent to the PLSS for recycling as drinking water. And if you need to defecate, the suit holds it in place. Even the best units can't reprocess that stuff. Go before you put the suit on.</p>
<p>Most suits include gauges on wrists and chest that allow the wearer to check battery life, pressure, temperature, air and the PLSS system. Some designs integrate these into a Heads Up Display that appears on the wearer's faceplate. Comms are all voice-activated, with a wrist-mounted manual control as a backup. Controls for the PLSS are also mounted on the same wrist controller. It is standard practice to switch on the helmet camera when working. It means you aren't alone, comrades inside the base or ship can give you guidance and advice, and everything you see is recorded for later analysis. A small light illuminates the wearer's immediate working area.</p>
<p>The PLSS can be recharged (air, water and electricity) at dedicated connectors within most airlocks. Other places, such as mining facilities, may have large banks of connectors in an EVA prep hall for many users to top up their PLSS at once. Every acceleration couch in a spacecraft includes an umbilical allowing the wearer to take off the PLSS (it gets in the way when laying in the couch) and rely on air from the vehicle if needed.</p>
<h2 id="donning-your-suit">Donning Your Suit</h2>
<p>It is possible to climb inside a vacc suit whilst wearing regular clothes, but they'd better be tight-fitting. Without the water-cooled full-body garment, the urine connections won't work, and any movement becomes hot and sweaty. Increase the action penalty by -1 after 2 hours. Putting on a suit properly requires 5 minutes if help is available 10 minutes if it isn't. Taking the suit off takes minutes. It is possible to do either of these faster in an emergency! Use the tasks below to speed up the process (do not factor in the suit's action penalty).</p>
<p><em>Putting on a vacc suit while under stress</em>: Vacc Suit, 3 rounds, Difficult (-2)</p>
<p><em>Taking off a vacc suit while under stress</em>: Vacc Suit, 2 rounds, Difficult (-2)</p>
<h2 id="pre-breathing">PRE-BREATHING!</h2>
<p>To work effectively in a vacuum within a soft suit, pressure must be reduced to stop ballooning. However, with less air comes less oxygen, and the wearer will need to switch the air to 100% oxygen or risk blacking out. The downside is that partial pressures usually result in decompression sickness ('the bends'). Nitrogen in the blood is no longer constrained by pressure and bubbles out into muscles and vital organs.</p>
<p>To prevent this, the space-walker must pre-breathe pure oxygen for 3 hours to purge nitrogen from his bloodstream. An EVA is almost an inverse of an ocean dive. The diver comes up from high water pressure to the low pressure of the surface. The spacewalker leaves the high pressure of the spacecraft for the low pressure of space. The spacewalker risks the 'bends' as soon as the EVA begins, not after.</p>
<p><em>Avoiding the Bends</em>: Endurance, DM-1 per hour of spacewalk (roll every hour)*</p>
<p>* Assumes being in a vacuum in a soft suit with no time to pre-breath oxygen (i.e. an emergency decompression or urgent rescue EVA).</p>
<h3 id="the-bends">The Bends</h3>
<p>Symptoms of the bends (deep pain, confusion, fatigue) occur 1D6 hours after the start of the spacewalk. The spacer makes an End roll and, if <em>successful</em> suffers 2D6 damage. </p>
<p>If <em>unsuccessful</em>, the bends are almost undoubtedly fatal (6D6 damage). Immediate medical care with an oxygen mask and medkit can reduce damage by 8 points.</p>
<p><em>Treating the Bends</em>: Medic, 1-6 hours, Average</p>
<h2 id="breach">BREACH!</h2>
<p>Once a suit is breached (perhaps from colliding with a piece of sharp debris while the wearer is repairing a drive), it takes 1-3 turns (roll 1D3) for the suit itself to self-repair the tear. In the first turn, the wearer suffers 1 pt of damage. In the second turn, he suffers 2 pts of damage, and in the third and subsequent turns, he suffers 4 pts.</p>
<p>The damage is instant and often fatal for larger breaches, depending on the environment. Lack of oxygen might cause suffocation, toxic gases cause injury, and extremely high or low breach temperatures cause damage.</p>
<p><em>Repairing a major breach</em>: Vacc Suit, 1D3+1 rounds, Difficult (-2), or Very Difficult (-4) if repairing one's own suit.</p>
<p>All suits include a suit repair kit.</p></div>
