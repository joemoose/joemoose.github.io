<h2 id="descriptions">Descriptions</h2>
<p><strong>Aldine Max-Shears</strong>: Heavy-duty wire-cutting shears, a basic tool. Cost $50. Mass 0.5kg.</p>
<p><strong>ASA RQ-456 Blizzard Aerial Drone</strong>: A miniature robotic quad-copter drone with camera, microphone and thermal imager used by security companies to protect properties by overflying the area. It has a 2 hr endurance, a range of 1000m and moves 50m/turn. They are operated from a dedicated portable control unit.</p>
<p><strong>Bauspace Fashion 45</strong>: A case full of polycarbonate skin and hair grafts, contact lenses, and other gear (such as false teeth, etc.) that anyone can use to transform their appearance into something different. Includes a variety of living ‘false faces’ grown on collagen and shark-cartilage polysaccharides. These seem utterly real but can only be worn for 3-5 hours at a time before they begin they deform.</p>
<p><strong>CRM Pro-Security Sonic Unit</strong>: This rifle-like piece of gear can be pointed at a wall or pane of glass and pick up any conversations on the other side. Its range is line of sight. It comes with a table-top tripod that can be folded for ease of mobility and a black acrylic case.</p>
<p><strong>Gulfstar PLB2 Personal Locator Beacon</strong>: A wrist-mounted emergency beacon with a range (once activated) of up to 10 km. The PLB uses a standard emergency frequency that can be tracked by any modern avionics system, Gulfstar Hand Radio, or Novomo EM Scanner. The signal will last for 24 hours. Cost $100. Mass negl.</p>
<p><strong>Inferno Electronics J34 Motion Tracker</strong>: The Inferno Electronics J34 Motion Tracker is a hand-held unit with a simple shoulder strap that uses discriminatory Doppler shift ultra-sound scanning to detect movement within a 100-degree cone ahead of the operator. Range varies, from 10-20m indoors to almost 600-800m in open country. They are useful tools, but subject to varied limitations, anything that moves can show up on the reading if not properly tuned out, extremely slow-moving objects may not show up at all, and of course, any enemy listening in will probably detect the loud ultra-sound bursts being emitted from the J34. The referee makes an Average Comms roll on the player’s behalf to operate a motion tracker. With success, he can give the player a pretty accurate indication of what the scanner is picking up; if unsuccessful, he should give the player false data. Player involvement can be increased by letting them roll one of the 2D6, with the referee rolling the other in secret. Cost: $1680. Mass 1kg.</p>
<p><strong>Inferno IR Detector 67</strong>: Portable unit that can be stuck to a wall or door. It sends a unique signal if tripped to a bug detector or hand radio, or it can just give off an audible alarm. Can pick up motion through the door or wall if not too thick.</p>
<p><strong>IE 505 Military Security Kit</strong>: This military/intelligence-only unit can access card locks and re-route the data to try and fool the lock’s onboard processor into believing that it is the correct card. The processor unit is attached to a ‘trojan’ card via a multi-wire cable and is all carried in a large fold-out wallet. It allows a person with Security skill to try and break through a card lock. Custom-made decryptors put together by crime gangs are generally illegal. Cost $1,000. Mass 200 kg.</p>
<p><strong>iTek Bug 4</strong>: These tiny bugs have a range of 100m and transmit for 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>iTek Bug 7</strong>: With a fisheye lens, these micro-cameras give a distorted 180-degree view and record sound. They are often disguised as a button or part of furniture. They transmit out to 100m for 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>iTek Line-Stop</strong>: This unit transmits all information that it picks up from a fibre-optic cable within 2cm. It can send the signal out to 100m indefinitely.</p>
<p><strong>iTEk Optics 88 Optic Probe</strong>: Fiber-optic lens and cable attachment for cameras that can be pushed under doors, around corners etc., for surveillance purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Lockpick Wallet</strong>: An ad-hoc kit of tools designed to defeat manual door locks.</p>
<p><strong>Luna 21 Forensics Toolkit</strong>: Required for investigating crime scenes and testing samples. This kit contains diagnostic sensors, hand tools, computer analysis programs and spare parts. Cost $1,000. Mass 3 kg.</p>
<p><strong>Mo-Dyne Binders Handcuffs</strong>: Steel handcuffs for holding prisoners in check.</p>
<p><strong>Norden LSGS Flashlight</strong>: A waterproof and impact-resistant flashlight, roughly 20 cm in length, with an endurance of 6 hours. A flashlight produces a wide cone of light up to 18 meters long with a radius of 6 meters at the end of the beam. Cost $120. Mass 1kg.</p>
<p><strong>Novomo Pro-Series EM Scanner</strong>: This device detects the electromagnetic emissions of technological devices and can be used as a diagnostic tool when examining equipment (+1 DM to work out what’s wrong with it) or when searching for hidden bugs or devices. The Comms skill can be used to sweep a room for bugs. Cost $450. Mass 0.2kg.</p>
<p><strong>Novomo PLT-6320</strong>: The PLT-6320 is a hand-held radio jamming unit with a 100m range and will disrupt most radio signals. It will also interfere with security motion sensors, jamming their frequencies. Mass 1kg. The Advanced Jammer (the Novomo PLT-7000) is available, with a 3km range. It is, however, backpack-sized.</p>
<p><strong>Sony Matrix DD1018 Digital Camera</strong>A hand-held digital camera capable of still photography and video. It is capable of low-light photography and includes an in-built timer. The camera can take 300 still shots or up to two hours of video. It can be plugged directly into any computer to download images and videos. Cost $500. Mass 1kg.</p>
<p><strong>Toshiba Securacom Scrambler</strong>: Such a unit fits over any telephone or hand-held radio and scrambles the message before it relays it to another phone or radio. The receiver must also have a unit set to the same code. Will stop the casual listener.</p>
<p><strong>Zenith CF Falcon Binoculars</strong>: These high-tech binoculars feature low-light night- vision and a laser range-finder. Cost $300. Mass 1kg.</p>
