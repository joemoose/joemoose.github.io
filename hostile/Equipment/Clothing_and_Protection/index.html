<h2 id="descriptions">Descriptions</h2>
<p><strong>Battle Dress Utilities (BDU)</strong>: These are the tough, military-style utilities, patterned after the US Marine Corps’ Operational Combat Uniform (OCU) and made up of jacket, shirt and pants. The utilities come in various colours as well as standard Marine camouflage patterns. The pants and jacket have multiple cargo pockets. Various brands offer utilities, including Novomo, Bauspace, KNiTK, and YoYo. Cost $160, Mass: negligible.</p>
<p><strong>Boots</strong>: A standard Marine Corps issue pair of SSG Commando Tactical Boots. They are used for civilian hiking and expedition work.</p>
<p><strong>Cold Weather Clothing</strong>: Protects against bitterly cold weather (-20o C or below). Adds a DM+2 to all Endurance checks made to resist the effects of cold weather exposure. Various brands offer arctic clothing, including Novomo, Bauspace, KNiTK, and YoYo. Cost $200. Mass 2 kg.</p>
<p><strong>Desert Clothing</strong>: Clothing suitable for hot desert conditions is not expensive and usually consists of a hat or headscarf to shade the head, sunglasses and loose-fitting trousers and shirts designed to cool the body. Exposed skin must be covered and protected. Includes sturdy desert boots. Various brands offer arctic clothing, including Novomo, Bauspace, KNiTK, and YoYo. Cost $80. Mass negligible.</p>
<p><strong>Enforcer M21 Rigid Plated Armor</strong>: Enforcer Armaments Corporation produces ERPA or rigid plated armour made of a composite alloy shell - mainly titanium aluminide alloy over a layer of boron carbide resin fixed to a core of carbon fibre. A Kevlar/Salar woven liner rounds off the protection. It comes in the form of a helmet; a full-torso, clamshell-style, rigid body shell; and a set of lower leg guards. The Enforcer M34 Helmet features a microphone, tactical camera, slide-down protective visor and an integral Zenith PRC-45 short-range radio. This is exclusively military or paramilitary. Cost $3250. Mass 4 kg.</p>
<p><strong>Hewison M5 Integrated Combat Suit</strong>: In environments where the warfighter requires complete environmental protection, Hewison Industries offers the M5 Integrated Combat Suit. This full-body suit protects against vacuum, high or low temperature, biological or chemical agents in unbreathable atmospheres and against radiation typically found in a hard vacuum (decreasing exposure by up to 40 rads/hr). It can support a soldier for six hours, much like a standard spacesuit, but the M5 is made of Kevlar and Salar woven layers sandwiching ceramic plates. Titanium-carbide plates reinforce vulnerable areas, and these rigid sections are backed by carbon fibre. The suit is coated with radar-absorbent neoprene polymer impregnated with conductive carbon black particles to reduce radar signature. The suit includes a Zenith PRC-45 radio, multi-beam flashlight, tethers and equipment pockets, TapTintTM anti-flash visor technology and thermal masking. This last feature provides the infantryman with a modicum of stealth against infra-red sensor devices: heat is sunk into a chill can, which must be replaced after one hour of use. The M5 is exclusively frontline military. Cost $20,000. Mass 18 kg.</p>
<p><strong>KNiTK Poncho</strong>: A useful hooded waterproof coverall, with a reversible sun- reflective inner). Cost $30. Mass 0.5kg.</p>
<p><strong>McConnell 456 Soft Suit</strong>: The soft vacc suit can be used in a vacuum, but the air pressure must be reduced to prevent ballooning. This requires wearers to have spent some hours before the EVA pre- breathing oxygen. Because of this, hard suits are instead routinely used for work in a vacuum or near-vacuum. Soft suits, meanwhile, are used on planetary surfaces for protection against low pressures, radiation (decreasing exposure by up to 20 rads/hr), cold temperatures and unbreathable atmospheres. The suit has a duration of six hours. Cost $6,000. Mass 12 kg.</p>
<p><strong>McConnell 720 Mining Suit</strong>: Designed for hard, physical labour and includes advanced temperature control, climbing harness, flashlights and rad counter. Used by miners or others working in hazardous conditions, the suit is a soft suit with a rigid torso and significant armoured protection (AR 6). The mining suit can be used in a vacuum, just like soft suits, but the air pressure must be reduced to prevent ballooning. This requires wearers to have spent some hours before the EVA pre-breathing oxygen. Because of this, hard suits are instead routinely used for work in a vacuum or near-vacuum. The suit has a duration of eight hours. Cost $9,650. Mass 9 kg.</p>
<p><strong>Stern B Ballistic Vest</strong>: This tactical vest protects the torso and is worn over clothing. Made of woven Salar and Kevlar ballistic cloths, the vest is suitable for protection against low-calibre rounds and high-velocity fragmentation with hardened lightweight K-type ceramic inserts. In a variety of colours or camo patterns. Includes lots of pockets for carrying ammo and equipment. Cost $450. Mass 2 kg.</p>
<p><strong>Stern C Concealable Vest</strong>: A lightweight, soft ballistic vest for impact-resistant Salar and Kevlar fibres for the torso. The fabric absorbs impact energy and spreads it over the torso, resulting in bruising. It can be effectively concealed under regular clothing, although observers making an Int check at 8+ will notice something unusual. Cost $500. Mass 1 kg.</p>
<p><strong>Tharsis A38 Hard Suit</strong>: The hard vacc suit is the spacer's best friend, providing life support and protection when in space. For six hours, the suit provides a breathable atmosphere and protection from the extremes of temperature, low pressure, and radiation typically found in a hard vacuum (decreasing exposure by up to 40 rads/hr). Hard suits are rigid and have segmented joints for freedom of movement; they can operate at high pressures, which means wearers do not need to pre-breathe oxygen before use. Cost $9,000. Mass 9 kg.</p>
<p><strong>Tharsis H200 Hostile Environment Suit</strong>: Hostile environment suits are designed for conditions where a normal vacc suit would be insufficient, such as deep underwater, worlds shrouded in toxic or corrosive gases, extremes of radiation or temperature, or other locales that offer serious physical danger as well as the lack of a breathable atmosphere. HEV suits provide all the life support of a normal vacc suit (for six hours). Still, they are also impervious to flames, intense radiation found at nuclear blast sites (decreasing radiation exposure by 90 rads/hr), and high-pressure environments like undersea trenches. Cost $18,000. Mass 40 kg.</p>
<p><strong>Tharsis H-10 Survival Suit</strong>: Designed to protect the wearer from extreme cold or heat (-50oC to +50oC), the environment suit has a hood, gloves and boots but leaves the face exposed in everyday operations. It uses a power cell to provide internal heating or cooling. Although the survival suit offers a good seal against moisture or heat loss, the survival suit is not airtight or pressurised. Power cells will last for 20 days. Cost $500. Mass 2 kg. Armour Rating 2.</p>
<p><strong>Yoshiko GP Surface Mask</strong>: A standard Off-World survival mask that can filter contaminants, taints smoke and dust (atmosphere types 4, 7, and 9) and compress breathed air to allow survival in a low-pressure atmosphere (types 2 and 3). Useful in Very Thin or Tainted atmospheres. Cost $150. Mass negligible.</p>
