<p><strong>Maze Labs Geo-Surveyor 1200</strong>: A powerful magnetometer, based around a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) typically mounted on a rugged four-wheeled trolley that can be pulled by hand or by a quad track or ATV. The squid is used to detect the magnetic fields around magnetic types of ore. Still, it also provides valuable information about the general geological structure of the rock layers using magnetic information. The wheeled rig weighs 75kg and costs $10,000. This includes the Model/1 data terminal, which displays and records the data. This data is recorded on the optical disc.</p>
<p><strong>McConnell 720 Mining Suit</strong>: This vacc suit is well-designed for hard, physical labour and includes advanced temperature control, climbing harness, flashlights and rad counter. Used by miners or others working in hazardous conditions, the suit is a soft suit with a rigid torso and significant armoured protection (AR 6). The mining suit can be used in a vacuum, just like soft suits, but the air pressure must be reduced to prevent ballooning. This requires wearers to have spent some hours before the EVA pre-breathing oxygen. Because of this, hard suits are instead routinely used for work in a vacuum or near a vacuum. The suit has a duration of eight hours. Cost $9,650. Mass 9 kg.</p>
<p><strong>M1967 Folding Spade</strong>: A folding military shovel that packs down to the size of a baseball glove and fits into a snug protective case. One edge of the blade is serrated, allowing it to be used as a crude saw. This is an instrumental piece of equipment. Cost $30. Mass 1.5 kg. Combat: Close Quarters Range, DM -2, 2D6.</p>
<p><strong>Norden Deepcore Electric Auger</strong>: Man-portable boring machine used to drill holes into soft rock or soil. Cost $800. Mass 25kg.</p>

<p><strong>Orica KL Detonator</strong>: A cylindrical detonator (or blasting cap) used to ignite detcord or plastic explosive. Each small detonator is pushed into C-4 or the end of the detcord, and the attached firing line (100m long) is plugged into a Shot Exploder. Detonators do contain PETN or ASA (lead azide, lead styphnate and aluminium) and can explode themselves (and do 2D6 damage) if treated very harshly. Cost $50. Mass 1kg (With a 100m-long firing line).</p>
<p><strong>Reiner-Gama 200 Portable Diesel Generator</strong>: A portable power unit can be invaluable in an environment without electricity. This 7000-watt generator can fit in the back of a four-wheel-drive; it provides continuous electricity for 7 hours and includes a charging adaptor for most power cells. It runs on diesel, requiring 20 litres for a full tank and has an electric starter. Be warned that the generator is a diesel engine and makes a lot of noise. Cost $4500. Mass 170kg(with a full tank).</p>

<p><strong>Snap-Fix Griffin Bolter</strong>: A bolt gun designed to ram rock bolts quickly into the ground. The electric motor charges a pneumatic reservoir, giving the bolt gun its punch. $200. Mass 2kg. Combat: Thrown Range, DM -2, 4D6, one shot.</p>
<p><strong>Stern CD3 Blasting Mat</strong>: Used in conjunction with mining explosives, the mat is a 3m by 10m wire-cable mesh backed with industrial Kevlar. Once unrolled, it is dragged into place over the rock structure to be blasted and pinned down with rock bolts. Cost $2000. Mass 75kg.</p>
<p><strong>Tharsis A38 Hard Suit</strong>: The hard vacc suit is the spacer's best friend, providing life support and protection when in space. The suit provides a breathable atmosphere and protection from the extremes of temperature, low pressure and radiation typically found in a hard vacuum (decreasing exposure by up to 40 rads/hr) for six hours. Hard suits are rigid and have segmented joints for freedom of movement. They can operate at high pressures, so wearers do not need to pre-breathe oxygen before use. Cost $9,000. Mass 9 kg.</p>
<p><strong>Titanobel T31 Shot Exploder</strong>: An electrical unit on a carry sling is used to send a current along a firing line to ignite a detonator. Up to six firing lines can be plugged into the unit at one time for a simultaneous blasting. Charging the capacitor takes 2 minutes. Cost $2100. Mass 4 kg.</p>
<p><strong>Titanobel Detcord</strong>: Long plastic tubes of an explosive, usually pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN). It has a wide variety of uses, including cutting pipes and trees, breaching doors, etc. Miners feed detcord into pre-drilled holes in the rock face. When detonated, the rock face is shattered.</p>
<p><strong>Yoshiko AD321 Floodlight</strong>: Portable floodlight mounted on a telescopic pole. The pole ends in four legs and can be pegged into the ground. At the base of each light is a rechargeable power cell. The floodlight has power for 16 hours of continuous operation. Cost $400. Mass 8kg.</p>
