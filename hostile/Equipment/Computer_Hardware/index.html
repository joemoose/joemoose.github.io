<p><strong>Data Cards</strong>: The primary method of mobile information storage resembles modern-day smart cards. The inside of a data card contains an embedded microprocessor. Data cards include RAM and a 16-bit microprocessor; they use a serial interface and receive their power from the card reader. Mass negligible cost $5. ROM Cards, however, are used to hold software and are slotted into ROM ports on a computer. Software is not installed onboard a portable terminal or workstation. ROM cards, like 1980’s game cartridges, are slotted into the unit to interface with the onboard processor. A computer can hold and run as many ROM Cards as equal to its rating. A single ROM Card contains one program, and the cost is given overleaf.</p>
<p><strong>Mainframes</strong>: Corporations use mainframes, as do starships. These powerful computers are supported by a wired network that can be accessed via one or more workstations. Each workstation resembles a modern personal computer (PC), with a keyboard and monitor. Mainframes weigh around 100 kg and are usually fitted into a small purpose-built computer room with one or more workstations (see below).</p>
<p><strong>Optical Discs</strong>: Used as a more powerful file storage platform and the central format for playing media (video and audio). The standard Baumann GmbH MiniDisk series holds up to 15.9 gigabytes of data, and each glass disc is permanently mounted within a small, rectangular plastic case. The disc can withstand extreme temperatures and pressures and is predicted to hold its data internally for millennia. Their mass is negligible, and their cost is $15 each.</p>
<p><strong>Optical Disc Player</strong>A portable unit with a flip-up colour screen that can play MiniDisks. It incorporates built-in speakers and a storage area within the case for up to twenty Baumann MiniDisks. Although most Portable Terminals have MiniDisk readers, they can only read data from the discs and cannot play video or audio. The character will require a dedicated Disc Player with its colour screen capabilities. Mass is 2 kg, and the cost is $250.</p>
<p><strong>Portable terminals</strong>: Stand-alone computers resemble modern laptops with hinged cases and often run dedicated software; however, they must be connected to the hardware they control via a cable. Controls for complex field equipment require these dedicated laptops, usually supplied in tough, anti-shock cases with integral carry handles. Portable terminals are also known as cyberdecks because of their typical use to access cyberspace. Portable terminals weigh 5 kg and are rated from Model/1 to Model/6.</p>
<p><strong>Workstations</strong>: Model/0 are 'dumb stations' used to access a mainframe and cannot run its programs. Workstations, however, can also be stand-alone computers, much like modern-day PCs. They have integral processors and hard drives with dedicated software. Workstations in some installations or businesses will often be connected via a wired network and can be rated as a Model/1 to a Model/4. A workstation weighs around 10kg (without a chair and console unit) and costs $250.</p>
<p><strong>E-Board</strong>: Clipboard-sized, hand-held Model/0 terminal running administration and record-keeping software. It has a monochromatic screen with an in-built stylus. The memex is rugged, and it features a data card slot and a spring-loaded jack cable for plugging into any videofone unit that enables it to access the Network. This electronic clipboard (‘e-board’) weighs 2 kg and costs $250.</p>
