<h2 id="descriptions">Descriptions</h2>
<p><strong>Aerodyne CLT-15 Cargo-loader</strong>: A wheeled scissor-lift container-carrier, powered by Gulfstar K27 Fuel Cell, used on many It starport ramps. It can carry a single ton intermodal container to the pad, raise it to a cargo hatch with its scissor lift action (up to 6m off the tarmac) and, using powered rollers, slide the box into the ship's hold. It is driven from a small cab mounted on the vehicle's side.</p>
<p><strong>AMC Aspen Four-Door Car</strong>: A popular road car used on Earth and some of the Off-World colonies. It is powered by a 110 kW fuel cell and can carry four passengers with 100 kg luggage.</p>
<p><strong>AMC Dynamic 7100 Mobile Mining Laser</strong>: Used on Off-World Mining installations, the Dynamic 7100 utilises a 50 MW deuterium fluoride laser to vaporise unwanted rocky material and cut ore up into manageable chunks ready for transport by the loader to the processor. The laser is mounted in a remotely operated turret on a 3-ton caterpillar-tracked chassis. The Dynamic is powered by a 980kw closed-cycle fuel cell, has a crew of 2 (driver and laser operator) and is equipped with towing bars, winches and a dozer blade, giving: some general versatility. The cab is not pressurised, although the vehicle can operate in a vacuum if the crew are suited.</p>
<p><strong>AMC Roadmaster 20-ton Truck</strong>: A common sight on highways, turnpikes and motorways, the Roadmaster is a twin axle, six-wheeled truck, classed as 'mid-sized' that has high body clearance making it popular also with the US military (in a modified version). The Roadmaster is powered by a 235 kW fuel cell (which can also be switched over to serve as a powerplant for other purposes if needed) and can carry 8,000 kg of cargo on its flatbed. The cab has room for two passengers. There are hundreds of variations of the Roadmaster apart from the military version, including enclosed cargo box bodies, chemical tankers, crane booms and refrigerated cargo boxes (reefers').</p>
<p><strong>Chevrolet MM5 Bucket-Loader</strong>: A powerful four-wheeled excavator, the MM5 includes a weatherproof cab. Its Aztec 280 kW fuel cell powerplant can also work in vacuum environments, providing the operator wears a vacc suit. It is entirely off-road capable, with large and rugged wheels and a front end bucket capable of scooping up to 5,000 kg of material in one go. They are used by mining corporations across the Outer Rim and construction firms back on Earth.</p>
<p><strong>General Exoframes GE9</strong>: Workloader A powered exoskeleton operating on a Gulfstar K24 Fuel Cell that features two hydraulic vice manipulators on the end of each arm. Its legged, walking design serves as an excellent machine for varied loading tasks, loading in confined areas or over rough terrain. The Loader has a single operator, and it can lift to 4,000 kg. or a single 1-ton ICO container.</p>
<p><strong>Global Dynamics ARCC-50 Armoured Combat Carrier</strong>: Each ARCC is a well-armoured hostile environment rover with complete life support systems for one month, advanced imaging systems and electronic defences, with a cabin able to carry a 13-man squad. The crew of the ARCC is two: driver and gunner/commander. For self-defence, the standard personnel carrier version of the ARCC carries a cupola-mounted GAU-122 25mm Gatling gun and a dorsal turret mounting two Zenith 28 MW free-electron pulse lasers. Other units in the US army and marines have their ARCC variants. The ARCC is powered by a 450 kW fuel cell (a requirement when operating in vacuum conditions) and can achieve 90 kph with an operational range of 400 km.</p>
<p><strong>Global Dynamics UD-5 Mustang Dropship</strong>: The Mustang is a military spaceplane capable of reaching orbit and re-entering the planet's atmosphere. Mustangs are often used to drop marines onto an alien world with their APC and then return them to orbit to rendezvous with their starship. Each Mustang must fulfil various battlefield roles, the most important of which is troop transport dropping an ARCC and its passengers directly onto a planetary surface. Additional duties include general transport, recon, tactical air support for the ground forces (especially the ARCC and its squad), forward observation, medevac, and search and rescue. As an air support platform, the dumpy but powerful Mustang boasts a forward-firing 25mm Gatling Gun and two rocket pods, each carrying twelve 70mm unguided rockets. The Mustang can operate in an atmosphere with its thrust vectored jet turbines, and it is equipped with a Nortinghouse FDT-1124 ram rocket for exoatmospheric manoeuvring. The dropship has tons of fuel, enough for three burns: one gets it into orbit, the other it uses to deorbit and begin its descent into Earth's atmosphere, the third is used for loitering and up to hours of atmospheric flight. Under 60,000 feet altitude, the UD-5 Mustang is limited to subsonic speeds. An aft-facing cargo ramp extends to the floor for loading. There are folding acceleration seats for seven troops on either side of the cargo bay. A 5-ton APC can be driven up inside the cargo bay with the seats unoccupied, and no cargo carried. The Mustang has a 20-ton hull, costs $4M and requires a pilot and crew chief.</p>
<p><strong>GoMo QuadTrack</strong>: A two-seat all-terrain quad bike, the Quad Track employs four independent tracked assemblies rather than four wheels, giving it impressive off-road performance. A driver sits up front with the handlebar controls while the passenger sits on a seat behind him. A 250kg equipment rack extends from the back of the fuel-cell-powered vehicle. The QuadTrack is popular with mining groups and Off-World exploration teams.</p>
<p><strong>Gulfstar Growler Utility Combat Vehicle (UCV)</strong>: The Growler is a four-wheel drive, utility combat vehicle, a light truck with dozens of military applications, from light transport to medevac, reconnaissance and fire support. It has space for a driver and three passengers, with a short flat-bed at the rear for small cargoes. Many variants remove the rear seating and introduce a flatbed deck for a heavy weapons mount or a large cargo deck. The Growler incorporates floor armour as well as armoured doors and windows. A ring mount in the roof allows the front passenger to stand and operate a belt-fed M5A5 12mm coilgun machine gun. It is powered by a 180 kW fuel cell and can achieve a top speed of 90 kph.</p>
<p><strong>Leyland-Okuda Javelin 4X</strong>: A private supersonic jet used on Earth by VIPs, governments and corporations to travel intercontinental distances. The Javelin carries a flight crew of two, one cabin attendant and 15 passengers. It is capable of 2,000 kph (Mach 2) and has a maximum range of 10,000 km.</p>
<p><strong>Lockhart CV-24M Super-Osprey Tilt-Rotor Aircraft</strong>: This general-purpose tilt-rotor aircraft has been in service for eighty years and is an upgraded version of the original Bell/ Boeing Osprey. With stub wings and rotating turbofan engine nacelles on the tips, the 'super-sprey' is capable of vertical take-off like a helicopter and then a transition to standard forward flight, with a respectable aircraft-like speed of 560 kph. It has a range of 950 km and carries three crew (two pilots and a loadmaster/ crew chief) and up to 24 combat-equipped troops. They are used by many airforces and militaries around the world.</p>
<p><strong>McConnell AV-105 Jump-Jet Gunship</strong>: This military version of the MX Vector is equipped with mil-spec avionics and countermeasures. Its standard weapons fit includes a chin-mounted turret with 25 mm cannon and side-mounted 70mm rocket pods usually coupled with M30 anti-armour missile launchers. The AV-105 can serve as a battlefield tank destroyer or as protection for a flight of Vectors dropping troops into a landing zone. Speed is 420 kph and range around 400 km.</p>
<p><strong>McConnell MX Vector Utility Jump-Jet</strong>: Replacing helicopters in many roles, the utility jump jet uses vectored turbofans for stability, control and forward thrust. The Vector can be configured to carry either 16 passengers or 5,000 kg of cargo and incorporates a single side-mounted sliding door and a rear cargo ramp. It is used for search and rescue, cargo or passenger transport, fire-fighting, observation and police duties. It requires a crew of two. Speed is 420 kph and range around 400 km.</p>
<p><strong>Matsuyama EH1800</strong>: The EH1800 is an immense dump truck (or haul truck) used on Off-World mines to transport up to 20 tons (or 100,000 kg) of waste rock out of the mine or to ferry freshly mined ore to the processor. A bucket-loader loads it. The EH1800 is 10m in length, and the top of the cab stands 5.7m above the ground. A stairway on the side of the cab allows the driver to reach the door. These dump trucks are enormous, ponderous machines with an open-box bed hinged at the rear and equipped with hydraulic pistons to lift the front, allowing the material in the bed to be dumped on the ground behind the truck at the site of delivery. Powered by a 2000 kW fuel cell, the truck cab is unpressurised, requiring the drive to be suited whilst operating in hostile environments.</p>
<p><strong>Matsuyama Reachstacker RS1000</strong>: A wide wheel-base cargo mover operating on a Nortinghouse Transmat 310kw Gas Turbine with a single powerful telescoping boom ending in clamps that allow it to pick up, manipulate and rotate standard 1-ton, 2-ton and 3-ton cargo containers. It has a crew of one with an additional jump-seat, a 167kg tool bay and a reach of 15m. A variant is powered by a 280 kW fuel cell for work in oxygen-deprived atmospheres.</p>
<p><strong>Matsuyama Sirocco Multi-Purpose Vehicle (MPV)</strong>: This multi-purpose vehicle (MPV, or 'people-carrier') can carry seven passengers and 200 kg of luggage. The seating is configurable; it is possible to turn the rear seats inwards for a club-style arrangement. There is a rear door and a sliding door for passenger use on the vehicle's right-hand side. It is powered by a 150 kW fuel cell.</p>
<p><strong>Seonwu Firefox Tractor</strong>: The Seonwu Firefox Tractor is used as a multi-purpose all-terrain vehicle in the Off-World Colonies. It can carry a team of up to eight workers (including two drivers/operators) into harsh environments and within a toxic atmosphere. Each is fully enclosed and capable of sustaining eight people for one week in a vacuum, high or low-temperature environment or unbreathable atmospheres. It provides some protection from radiation but cannot survive the crushing pressures and metal-melting temperatures of a corrosive or insidious atmosphere (types B and C). A compact kitchen is built-in, along with a chemical toilet air and water recycling system. It has a 2,000 kg cargo area, and at the rear, power couplings to accept any of the following tools: digging tools ($25,000), cutting tools ($10,000), geology bore drills and samplers ($100,000), spring stampers ($50,000), welders ($10,000), dozer blade ($20,000), heavy telescopic crane ($100,000) or manipulator arms ($50,000). Each is interchangeable, requiring around 2 hours of work, a winch and some technical knowledge. The tractor is powered by a 1000 kW fuel cell. The maximum speed is 135 kph and range around 1200 km.</p>
<p><strong>Shinobi-Technics Hermes 206 Hovercar</strong>: The smallest jump-jets in operation are a whole new class of private vectored turbofan transports. Used by government authorities, large corporations, and the wealthy, these hovercars have added an extra transportation layer to cities. The Hermes hovercar requires a single pilot and has a capacity for three (cramped) passengers.
The luggage capacity is 250 kg. The Hermes is capable of a maximum of 300 kph in level flight but is generally restricted to airspace limits of 150 kph. The vehicle has fuel for 4 hours of operation and can reach 5,000 feet. A ballistic parachute system can be deployed in case of engine failure.</p>
<p><strong>Tharsis Aerospace Nimbus T23 Spaceplane</strong>: Human travel into orbit no longer depends on rockets or rocket mounted shuttles; Instead, comfortable and economical spaceplanes now make the journey. The Nimbus T23 series of spaceplanes are streamlined passenger liners capable of taking off from a runway on Earth and returning as gliders. The manoeuvre drive is a SABRE synergistic air-breathing rocket engine that accelerates the airliner to hypersonic speeds. It can reach low Earth orbit but not move beyond it. The T23 spaceplane has 6 tons of fuel, enough for two burns: one gets into orbit, and the other uses to deorbit and begin its descent into Earth's atmosphere. The Nimbus has a 40-ton hull and costs $3M. It has a crew of 4 and carries 30 passengers.</p>
<p><strong>Tharsis Armadillo GT800 All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV)</strong>: The Tharsis Armadillo is used when conditions are extreme, an all-terrain vehicle capable of carrying a team of explorers across a harsh environment and within a toxic atmosphere. Armadillos are used on alien worlds as trucks, personnel transports and expeditionary 'camper vans'. Each is fully enclosed and capable of sustaining eight people for one month in a vacuum, high or low-temperature environment or unbreathable atmospheres. It provides some protection from radiation but cannot survive the crushing pressures and metal-melting temperatures of a corrosive or insidious atmosphere (types B and C). A compact kitchen is built-in, along with a chemical toilet, air and water recycling system and eight fold-away sleeping cots. The Armadillo is powered by a 1000 kW fuel cell. Speed is typically 90 kph and range around 1200 km.</p>
<p><strong>Tharsis Coyote C180 Off-Road Vehicle</strong>: Rugged and hard-working, the Coyote is a powerful four-wheel-drive off-road utility vehicle capable of traversing steep slopes, rough terrain, sand, gravel, snow and mud. It is a common sight on the Off-World Colonies. Powered by a 180 kW fuel cell, the Coyote carries six passengers and 200 kg of cargo internally, with the capability to take another 100 kilograms of luggage on a roof rack.</p>
<p><strong>Voroncovo Forklift 4 Series</strong>: A compact four-wheeled cargo mover operating on a Gulfstar K24 Fuel Cell. It has one crew and can lift 2,000kg of palletised cargo to 4.5m.</p>
<p><strong>McConnell Kestrel Jump-Jet</strong>: A light, two-person scouting jump-jet built for harsh colonial conditions. Following a couple of hours of prep, the Kestrel is ready for flight. It can fly within hostile environments (hot, cold, radioactive, poison, etc.) and at altitudes up to 22,000. It includes a 250 kg cargo capacity. Range 2000 km.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Motors Dynacat</strong>: A rugged but straightforward amphibious all-terrain vehicle. Open topped, with basic skid steer controls, the Dynacat is an excellent runabout for colonial worlds, used by miners, farmers and technicians.
