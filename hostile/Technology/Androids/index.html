    <h1 id="androids">Androids</h1>
<p>Advances in bioelectronics throughout the 21st century saw the birth of the first androids but these marginally reactive semi-automatons only barely deserved the distinction. Confined by the same electronic principles that hindered their electronic cousins they were little more than programmable machines in human form. It was not until startling developments in wetware science and accompanying biorobotics emerged in the mid-22nd century that the dream of a true android became a reality. Through bioengineering specific cell structures, programming individual neurons and artificially sequencing DNA strands, a biological element was introduced into the otherwise electromechanical construction of the first android body and then the brain. The result was more than an advanced CPU, it was a fully functional biocomputer a synthetic organism. Technically it was a cyborg, as it contained both organic and synthetic components these androids, released for sale in 2170, were an entirely new construct, the offspring of a whole new technology, all the way down to the cellular level. Transdyne Cybersystems led the research and development in this new field for decades and was quick to seize both legal a copyright and a manufacturing and marketing monopoly on the technology. All legally manufactured androids are Transdyne models without exception.</p>
<p>Programming has steadily improved from the earliest Alpha models that could acknowledge and respond to a limited list of verbal commands only, to the fully interactive and emotive Gamma models of the 2190s. It was in 2209 however that the first sentient computer was brought online, not by Transdyne however but by rival. Four years later the rival company was forced into bankruptcy and all of their assets, research and the prototype AI became the property of TDC. The move was not swift enough to stop the appearance of a number of sentient computer core designs with various corporate labels (Leyland Okuda, for example) but it assured TDC was at the forefront of new AI development. In 2214 the new Epsilon-series was launched as the first truly sentient, synthetic life form.</p>
<p>The Epsilon-series android was a not simply a self-aware computer, however. Several models of AI-CPU had earned that distinction first and were already performing services in a number of applications, from industry to research and even spacecraft mainframe monitoring and control. These fully responsive and intelligent machines were marvels in their own right but the unique nature and construction of the Transdyne androids took this technology to an amazing and truthfully unexpected apex. When coupled with the wetware convergence of machine and organic construction the android became more than aware, it was sentient, for all pretences, alive. What the bio-electronic brain lacked in conventional memory and processing, it expanded in ways even the technicians could not have anticipated. Each android began to develop, immediately upon activation, as an individual. Attempts to install the android consciousness into traditional computer roles proved disastrous, the subjects developing destabilizing neurosis or simply shutting down from the stress. When given the opportunity to perform as an individual however, they often exceeded their programming, achieving a level of sophistication that what not unlike the beginnings of personality.</p>
<p>The Epsilon-series is now in its 7th model and has performed beyond all expectations. Androids have found : place not only as functional assistants but have demonstrated the ability to act independently, form relationships and enhance their initial programming. They remain somewhat restricted in the area of expressed emotion and it is still believed by most that what the android may express as preference, opinion, or creative thought is still just a matter of programmed behavioural algorithms. There is a movement by some however to grant androids status as living beings as with generations the distinction between artificial and actual life form becomes more blurred.</p>
<h2 id="android-fabrication">Android Fabrication</h2>
<p>The modern android is human-like, electro-mechanical cyborg designed for harsh conditions or monotonous tasks (or both). Built around a sturdy carbon fiber skeleton is a complex system of silicon muscles that stabilizes and controls. An outer covering of bio-plastic sheeting is built up on top of a layer of flexible collagenous fibers. The most modern androids operate with a Model/4 computer running either a level 1, 2 or 3 Intellect program. To calculate an android's Intelligence in comparison to a human, add 5 to its Intellect program level (giving it a character Intelligence characteristic of 6-8). An android's social standing stands at a default level of 0.</p>
<p>Power is provided for around three months by a 25 kW fuel cell requiring a liquid hydrogen fuel. Obviously, androids do not need to breath, drink or eat, but they do occasionally ingest a pale-coloured, semi-organic nutrient suspension in a siliconbased liquid medium; this serves as a lubricant for the system's micro-hydraulics. Some attempt to fit in' to their mission teams by eating and drinking at meal-times, these nutrients will pass through the system harmlessly until emptied by the android. Such an ability allows an android to blend in seamlessly, even covertly.</p>
<p>The machinery, processor, fuel cell and carefully designed outer skin can be damaged, so it is prudent for androids to wear vacc suits or hostile environment suits. Vacuum, high pressure, high temperature and aggressive atmospheric chemical constituents can all irreparably damage an android. The cost of single unit precludes the avoidable and wasteful use of an android in such an environment. Most androids are competent and of average human intelligence. They are generally programmed with passive, non-aggressive personalities and are typically given the likeness of a mature (30-40 year-old) male or female. The aim is to blend in, to join in, to be team-player within a group of humans, supporting the leadership and providing useful options and advice without being forceful. Androids cannot harm humans and follow Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics. </p>
<p>Fifth generation (Epsilon-series) androids can be bought as stock models for a competitive price, or the customer cn customize his android from parts available at the factory. This only applies to the most recent series of TDC androids. Custommade units are ready for delivery within 6-10 months. Buyers must specify their preferred options. </p>
<p><strong>Repair Station</strong>: Androids require an upright repair station, massing around 200 kg into which the android itself, steps. A transparent lid then closes, and the android plugs in, and undergoes a diagnostic and lubricant change; the fuel cell is topped up with if liquid hydrogen also, if needed. Typically, androids will require a check-up every month or sO, or after sustaining damage. Minor damage can usually be repaired in 1-6 hours.</p>
<h2 id="next-generation-androids">Next Generation Androids</h2>
<p>AI technology such as that found in androids is biological computer or wetware core processor which creates a volitional thinking machine, neural network with high level of cognition. For the incredible complexity of free thought, creativity, problem solving, and volitional action to work reliably and stably over time, it was found to work most efficiently in form which mirrored the neurological structure of the human brain. The Transdyne android brain is formed around artificially constructed neurons and electrode pairs. It uses electrical signals to read and write to the neurons, which are kept at a stable temperature and PH level, etc. A fully sapient android brain has billions of these artificial neurons, with numbers approximating that of a human brain. Lower levels of complexity can create sentience, even primitive reasoning, but fifth generation Transdyne androids (and perhaps others) possesses truly human-like levels of brain power.</p>

<p>First generation (Alpha-series) androids were the earliest to use the wetware core processors that produced sentient machines. These experiments could feel and think, though they were suitable only for the simplest tasks. Many found uses as performers and expensive curiosities. </p>
<p>Second generation androids (Beta-series) were much smarter, but occasionally suffered stability and learning problems. While all androids were programmed to avoid violence against humans, second gen androids occasionally "lost their marbles' and lashed out at humans around them. This process fault was not fully understood, perhaps linked to poor quality control, but it caused a quick third generation android release (Gamma-series) which were generally stable. </p>
<p>TDC had found the right balance, and the Gamma-series machines, which came online in 2190, proved very popular as mining employees, rescue workers, logistics and support soldiers, and so forth. In fact, the old standby 'third-gens' are still big sellers for Transdyne.</p>
