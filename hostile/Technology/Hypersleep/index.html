    <h1 id="hypersleep">Hypersleep</h1>
<p>As already discussed in the Hyperdrive chapter, human beings have struggled and failed to retain their sanity whilst travelling through hyperspace. To that end targeted temperature management (TTM), or 'therapeutic hypothermia' was put into practice specifically for interstellar travel. TTM reduces a patient's core body temperature, cooling vital organs and slowing metabolic rates similar to those of hibernating mammals, such as the arctic ground squirrel. This space-faring technology is called statis or hypersleep, but is also known (erroneously) as cryogenic freezing or 'cryo'. This hibernation mimics the natural hibernation of bears and squirrels in the wintertime when food is scarce. Crew-members in stasis sleep and breathe very slowly, whilst food is administered by an intravenous pump. The and crewman still ages, albeit at a slightly a slower rate.</p>
<h2 id="hypersleep-pods">Hypersleep Pods</h2>
<p>Hypersleep stasis pods (or 'tubes') must be included for every human being onboard I hyperdrive-equipped starship; epilepsy, madness, insanity or coma will affect any living creature passing through hyperspace that is not protected by stasis. One hypersleep pod carries one crewman or passenger, costs $50,000, and displaces one-half ton. The pods are typically laid out in rows a within a dedicated stasis or hypersleep chamber. The walls of the chamber house lockers for clothing and personal items, and the berth typically includes a toilet and shower for last minute ablutions.</p>
<p>The hypersleep chamber is made up a of a contoured bed with heatable pads, fitted within an enclosed capsule. These have transparent and fireproof lids. The chambers are programmed by the starship computer to initiate, maintain and terminate hypersleep stasis of crew based on the length of the mission. Zero-loss lithium ion batteries within a backup system support the chamber's function for up to 100 years in case of emergency.</p>
<p>While individuals in status are removed from the effects of timeand incurable insanity, long periods of hypersleep can cause muscle tone to weaken, often leading to cramps and the diminishing of physical abilities upon waking. Even sO, stasis tubes are effective to the point of being able to sustain and suspend an individual for decades, although waking from such a lengthy period of stasis carries with it minor side effects, including nausea, exhaustion and dizziness, that may last for several days. Being removed from stasis abruptly without a proper wake-up procedure is dangerous, and while not usually fatal, it can lead to damage.</p>
<p><strong>Stasis Systems</strong></p>
<p>Passengers or crewmen entering stasis are actively cooled to a mild hypothermic state (defined as a core temperature between 32 to 34 Â°C). Shivering (a muscle activation response that tries to rewarm the body) is commonly suppressed with very low-level infusion of propofol and fentanyl, with the intermittent treatment of benzodiazepine. The ship's medic typically administers this first shot, whilst carrying out quick medical check to ascertain the suitability of the subject for stasis. He or she then helps the subject get settled in the chamber and inserts both a feeding drip, a urine catheter and the all-important cooling line. In most cases this cooling catheter would be inserted into the crew's femoral vein or into the chest. A double lumen, cooled saline solution is then is pumped a through a metal coated cooling line inserted into the subject's femoral vein. The saline cools a crewman's whole body by lowering the temperature of their blood through conduction cooling. No cooled fluid actually enters the patient's blood stream. The Haruna K560 Cool-Line is the most is common version of the stasis cooling system in use today.</p>
<p>All of the nutrition and hydration requirements of a crewman are provided by liquid solution that is administered via an intravenous (IV) feeding drip directly into the body. This aqueous solution contains all nutrients that the body needs to maintain full physiologic function and is fed slowly through the IV.</p>
<p>Once the ship's computer (or the android on-board) drops the ship out of hyperspace, it will initiate the crew wakeup procedure, pumping warm water into the veinal lines, and shutting off the feeding lines. It will also activate heating pads inside the seat cushion.</p>
<h2 id="passenger-ticketing-options">Passenger Ticketing Options</h2>
<h3 id="standard-class-starship-ticket-1000">Standard-Class Starship Ticket ($1,000)</h3>
<p>This is a ticket on a commercial liner. With standard-class ticket the passenger is frozen at the starport and shipped to the starship like freight. He or she has a meagre 10kg baggage allowance that fits into the locker at the foot of the hypersleep pod. </p>
<h3 id="elite-class-starship-ticket-8000">Elite-Class Starship Ticket ($8,000)</h3>
<p>This is also ticket on commercial liner. The elite-class ticket has more perks, however, reflecting its higher price tag. Passengers are given a drink and snack before being put into hypersleep on board ship, and they are woken on approach to their destination, giving them time to shower, dress, eat and acclimatize themselves to 'normal space' before deboarding the starship. In short, they are treated more like privileged crew than freight. Elite-class tickets include : generous 1000 kg baggage allowance that is carried in the ship's hold. A 10 kg 'carry-on bag' is also allowed that is stowed into the locker at the foot of the hypersleep pod.</p>
