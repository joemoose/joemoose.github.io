<h1 id="power">Power</h1>
<p>The power requirements of humans on Earth, in space and on the Off-World colonies is huge, and provided by a variety of technologies. Foremost for the populations of Earth and for those of the larger core colonies, fusion powerplants are utilised. The first fusion reactor began supplying electricity to customers in 2060.</p>
<h2 id="origins-of-fusion">Origins of Fusion</h2>
<p>Back in the 21St century, a Earth found a way to shake-off its dependence on Luna solar power energy when the first fusion reactor came online in 2060. The 'miracle powerplant', fusion reactors produced very little radioactive waste but incredible amounts of power. Various fuels are needed, such as deuterium and tritium, but the most sought after was helium-3. Although small amounts can be gathered on Earth, the greatest concentrations were in the solar system, waiting to be collected. This helium-3 was blasted into rocky surfaces by the solar wind and found on Mercury, the Moon and on the gas giants in the outer solar system. Earth had to secure a source of He-3 and it set its sights on Mercury, sending an initial colony to the Sobkau region in 2067. It wasn't to be. Expensive operations were sponsored that began to mine helium-3 from the Sobkou basin, but where was it all? To the shock of all concerned, it seemed that Mercury had very little of the precious material. It was now the dash for Saturn, and the vast amounts of helium-3 there, that quickly turned the Sobkou debacle into a forgotten memory.</p>
<p>The great expansion into the outer solar system began apace in the early 2070s. New rockets, nuclear thermal drives that were based around a fission gas-cored reactor using liquid hydrogen or water as a reaction mass, powered those long range missions. Fusion powerplants at that time were far too large to scale down enough for use as a space drive and so fission reactors remained the powerplant that allowed the exploration of the solar system. It was in 2084 that explorers from Earth arrived at Saturn with everything they needed to begin mining helium-3 from the gas giant's rich atmosphere. It established bases on the twin planetoids of Janus and Epimetheus; and there began a fusion industry that has continued into the present day. Helium-3 is extracted from Off-World colonies and shipped to Earth on multi-megaton starships to feed Earth's fusion reactors.</p>
<h2 id="the-tokamak-reactor">The Tokamak Reactor</h2>
<p>Helium-3 is a stable isotope of helium that is missing a neutron, with this missing neutron allowing for the production of clean energy. Two types of fusion reactions make use of Helium-3 to produce clean energy. The first uses deuterium (deuterium S a hydrogen with a neutron) reacting with Helium-3, to produce helium and a proton. The second type of reactions uses two atoms of helium-3 to create helium and two protons. The protons created during this last reaction are the crown jewel of Heliumfusion. One of the best parts of the Helium-3 reaction is the complete lack of radioactive by-products. No neutrons are emitted and no isotopes are left as products that could radioactively decay. The proton is a particularly nice side product, since clean energy can be harnessed from this stray proton by manipulating within in an electrostatic field. Traditional nuclear fission reactions used to create heat, which was then used to heat water. The boiling water forced turbines to spin and generate energy. In the helium-3 fusion process, energy iS created via the reaction itself, with no nasty radioactive material for future generations to monitor.</p>
<p>While industrial-grade super-conducting magnets arranged as toroid (a 'tokomak') suspend the fuel and hold it in place, the reactor uses a process called radiofrequency heating to ignite the nuclear fuel. Antennas outside the tokamak use a specific frequency of radio waves to excite the particles. The radio waves are specifically calibrated to target the helium-3 ions. Because the helium-3 accounts for only fraction of the fuel's total density, focusing the radio-frequency heating on the minority ions allows them to reach extreme energy levels. The excited ions then slam into the reactor's outer shell, generating heat and electricity. In order to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the nuclei, they must have a temperature of several tens of millions of degrees, under which conditions they no longer form neutral atoms but exist in the plasma state.</p>
<p>At these temperatures, no material container could withstand the extreme heat of the plasma. <strong>HOSTILE</strong> fusion tokamaks utilise magnetic confinement to create these conditions. They use the electrical conductivity of the plasma to contain it with powerful magnetic fields in the form of a hot plasma in the shape of spinning torus. Meanwhile the tokamak's superconducting magnets and support structure must be chilled close to absolute zero and so most reactor's require steady supply of liquid hydrogen as a coolant. Tokamaks are the workhorses of fusion solid, symmetrical, and relatively straightforward to engineer.</p>
<h2 id="space-based-reactors">Space-Based Reactors</h2>
<p>Whilst large-scale, planet-bound reactors utilise helium-3 as their reaction fuel, space-based and starship reactors may use deuterium, tritium or helium-3, expanding their fuel choices when isolated from abundant fuel sources. The fusion powerplants still require small amounts of liquid hydrogen as a coolant to function efficiently. The standard rules for powerplants in Cepheus Engine are used. A starship powerplant rating must be equal or higher to either the hyperdrive or half the ship's maneuver drive. Although it has no effect on game-play and serves only as set-dressing, starship powerplant ratings can be thought of as being equivalent to Giga Watts of power output; meaning that a Powerplant 4 starship produces 4 GW.</p>
<h2 id="micro-fusion-plants">Micro-Fusion Plants</h2>
<p>Extremely small fusion reactors are in production, suitable as mining power sources or the powerplants for shuttles and small craft. None have been licensed for use within air or ground vehicles due to the dangers of radiation following an accident. The larger marine ships do, however, utilise fusion power. As setting detail, we can assume that each micro-fusion powerplant rating is equivalent to 10 Mega Watts of power. A shuttle with a level 3 powerplant then, has a 30 a MW rating. The microfusion plant is not simply a scaled down tokomak, that would be an impossibility due CO size and weight considerations. Instead of confining the plasma within a doughnut-shaped ring, a series of superconducting coils generates a magnetic-field in which plasma is held within the broader confines of the entire cylindrical reaction chamber. Superconducting magnets within coils generate a magnetic field around the outer border of the chamber. The system is therefore regulated by self-tuning feedback mechanism, whereby the farther out the plasma goes, the stronger the magnetic field pushes back to contain it. Micro-Fusion plants currently range in size from 1.2 to 10.5 tons of displacement (6,000 52,500 kg).</p>
<h2 id="fuel-cells">Fuel Cells</h2>
<p>Petroleum is abundant, shipped to Earth via huge space-faring oil tankers, but much of this oil supplies the plastics industry. On Earth and in the OffWorld colonies, too, hydrogen fuel cells are the dominant form of vehicular power generation. Where oxygen exists within an atmosphere, then some colonial societies operate gas turbine vehicles, such as rovers, tractors, container lifters and trucks. Gas turbines require a petrochemical fuel, and kg. for kg. this still provides more power than an equivalent-sized fuel cell. Virtually all medium to large aircraft are also powered by gas turbine jet engines. The US military had relied on a gas turbine or petroleumdriven vehicle fleet until the 2120s, but deployments to the newly established OffWorld colonies soon highlighted a glaring shortcoming gas turbines are airbreathing engines, useless on vacuum worlds, or planets with poisonous and alien atmospheres. Within the next ten years, much of the US military switched to closed fuel cell vehicle powerplants that do not require sources of external oxygen the vehicles carry liquid oxygen tanks with them to supply the required oxidizer.</p>
<p>A fuel cell S an electrochemical cell that converts the chemical energy from a fuel into electricity through an electrochemical reaction of hydrogen fuel with oxygen or another oxidizing agent. Fuel cells are different from batteries in requiring a continuous source of fuel and oxygen (usually from air) to sustain the chemical reaction, whereas a in a battery the chemical energy comes from chemicals already present in the battery. Fuel cells can produce electricity continuously for as long as fuel and oxygen are supplied.</p>
<p>There are many types of fuel cells, but they all consist of an anode, a cathode, and an electrolyte that allows positively charged hydrogen ions (protons) to move between the two sides of the fuel cell. At the anode a catalyst causes the fuel to undergo oxidation reactions that generate protons (positively charged hydrogen ions) and electrons. The protons flow from the anode to the cathode through the electrolyte after the reaction. At the same time, electrons are drawn from the anode to the cathode through an external circuit, producing direct current electricity. At the cathode, another catalyst causes hydrogen ions, electrons, and oxygen to react, forming water. Fuel cells are classified by the type of electrolyte they use and by the difference in startup time ranging from 1 second for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEM fuel cells, or PEMFC) to 10 minutes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC).</p>
<h2 id="magnetohydrodynamic-generators">Magnetohydrodynamic Generators</h2>
<p>A magnetohydrodynamic generator (MHD generator) is a magnetohydrodynamic converter that transforms thermal energy and kinetic energy into electricity. MHD generators are different from traditional electric generators in that they operate at high temperatures without moving parts. MHD power plants create a plasma a by burning liquid hydrogen and oxygen, pushing the resulting plasma into the turbine where it creates electricity just like a regular generator, except that the plasma takes the place of the spinning coils in the regular generator. The fuel needs to ignite the fuel, to start the process, just as a spark is needed to start an internal combustion engine thereafter the turbine will produce net power.</p>
<p>The working fluid in a closed cycle MHD is circulated in a closed loop. Hence, in this case inert gas or liquid metal is used as the working fluid to transfer the heat. The liquid metal has typically the advantage of high electrical conductivity, hence the heat provided by the combustion material need not be too high. Contrary to the open loop system there is no inlet and outlet for the atmospheric air. Hence, the process is simplified to great extent, as the same fluid is circulated time and again for effective heat transfer.</p>
<p>Magnetohydrodynamic powerplants are becoming more popular as sources of power for large machinery, such as ships, hovercraft, trains, oversized trucks, submarines and tanks etc. Currently, PEM fuel cells are struggling to supply the energy required by these power hungry pieces of machinery. MHD powerplants are poised to fill that huge gap between fuel cell and micro-fusion.</p></div>
