<h1 id="computing">Computing</h1>
<p>Fitting the retro-tech setting of <strong>HOSTILE</strong>, computing more resembles the systems of the late 1980s than those of the early 21st century. Key differences are a lack of wi-fi cable-less technology and the absence of ultra-miniaturization of computing. There are no palm computers or smart phones and touch screen technology does not exist (apart from the advances made in the Hosaka Memex, see later). None of this means to say the computers in 2225 are not powerful and versatile machines, it's just that they have a number of minor limitations which we in the twenty-teens, are no longer familiar with. Forget full-colour LCD or plasma screens, too, the cathode-ray tube (CRT) monitors in HOSTILE are monochrome, typically green, although amber, blue and even white displays are in use (the actual colour depends on the type of phosphor being used to create the display.</p>
<p>The computers of the 22nd and early 23rd century certainly are wonders of technology, the culmination of decades of improvements in processing speed, data storage and in recent years, user interface and artificial intelligence. They are however bound mechanically by the electronic construction methods of the society they serve and in this regard computers have become faster, smarter and more intuitive but also larger, and more demanding of power and cooling. Even computerized sub-systems, control modules and monitoring equipment, along with a million other subtle applications in modern technology, must contend with the restrictions of their component parts. Chief among these is size. For all their sophistication and capability the computers of 2225 AD are solid, bulky and for the most part ugly. These are incredibly powerful machines but equally power hungry, frail, maintenance demanding and super-heated.</p>
<h2 id="mainframes">Mainframes</h2>
<p>Mainframes, the true work horses of the computer world, are large with spacecraft and naval shipping models requiring entire sections of the ship to commit to several tons of memory storage and processing equipment. Permanent ground installations in office blocks and corporate HQs can be even bigger with CPU speed and capability limited only by sheer acreage, power supply and coolant. Main frames are sealed behind ventilated metal shielding and sprout kilometres of electrical conduit, fiber optic cable and coolant lines. Temperatures must be continually controlled to keep CPUS at peak performance and mainframe berths are kept extremely cold, as a rule. Backup generators, redundant coolant equipment, fire suppression and other support machinery surround mainframes increasing their bulk and complexity. The tonnage assigned to the starship's bridge typically incorporates both avionics and much of this extensive computing infrastructure.</p>
<h2 id="workstations">Workstations</h2>
<p>Hard-wired workstations are the user portals into the computer brain of the mainframe. They are used to provide outputs from the mainframe and to allow access to its capabilities. Workstations are often used in factories, on colonies and on board starships and space-stations. Used to access i mainframe, the workstation has a rating of Model/0 (it does not run its own programs). Workstations, however, can also be stand-alone computers, much like modern-day PCs. They have integral processors and memory hard drives with their own dedicated software. Workstations in some installations or businesses will often be connected to one another via d wired network and can be rated as a Model/1 to a Model/4. A workstation weighs around 10kg (without chair and console unit) and costs $250.</p>
<p>Construction of a 'computer room' is de rigeur when a mainframe iS installed, in a building, starship or colony complex. This 6 metre-square room houses a master workstation which allows an operator to see every active monitor on the computer network, it allows deep-level programming to be carried out and must be used in those cases where the administration password is required. Typically the room requires a coded a pass to enter, either via an ID card slotted into a reader or a numeric keypad.</p>
<h2 id="portable-terminals">Portable Terminals</h2>
<p>Portable computers are available but provide a minimum of processing power and memory and weigh in at around 5kg. These stand-alone computers resemble modern laptops with hinged cases and they often run dedicated software; however they must be connected to the hardware they control via a cable. Controls for complex field equipment require these dedicated laptops, often supplied in tough, anti-shock cases with integral carry handles. Portable terminals like this are supplied along with remote sentry guns, uplink transmitters, portable radars and drones (amongst other things). Portable terminals weigh 5 kg and are rated from Model/1 to Model/4.</p>
<h2 id="interfacing">Interfacing</h2>
<p>Computer screens are monochromatic cathode screens for the most part, simplistic and purely functional in design with little thought to user appeal. Keyboards are the primary control interface for users, spring-loaded keys clacking loudly when entering data or command prompts. Some expert-system keyboards feature integral trackballs for the precise targeting or activation of commands or for interfacing with graphical displays. Voice recognition modules are available of course but are rarely utilized at workstations or remote terminals. Only direct communication with the central CPU typically warrants such a luxury and then only on top-of-the-line models. Peripherals such as memory storage disk drives and printers are common, with hardcopy printouts of critical data lines regular procedure for many users.</p>
<h2 id="the-data-network">The Data Network</h2>
<p>Working in an orbital hab, an outpost or in the science bay of starship, a character will have access to a Local Area Network (LAN) which constantly monitors machinery, environmental readings and subsystems using telemetry things like ATVs, vacc suits and drones all in real time. Of course the LAN also features extensive memory files and scientific software, but it is mainly concerned with monitoring and controlling a complex piece of machinery. Some corporations and other organisations run their own LANs known as intranets, closed systems that allow access to wider nets only through established data gateways.</p>
<p>A data network exists in 2225 that not only covers the entire Earth, but stations throughout the Solar System and all of the Off-World Colonies and outposts as far as the Outer Rim. It exists where communication exists, data piggy-backing on comlines to allow computers to transfer data and to communicate with one another. Today we call this the Internet, in HOSTILE it is known as the Integrated Data Network (IDN, or simply, 'Network'). Because communication is greatly delayed by the great interplanetary and interstellar distances involved, the Network employs a new set of protocols and technologies that are tolerant to large delays and errors. Data requiring transfer is bundled, stored and then forwarded and this means that instantaneous net usage is impossible. The Network across the Solar System is broken up into separate Planetary Area Networks (PANs), such as Earth-Net, TitanNet and so on. Likewise, the separate interstellar colony and outpost worlds have their own PANs (such as Hiroshima-Net). The huge communication time lag between worlds effectively closes these PANs off from one another and communication between them is effectively via text, voice or video email, forwarded data transfer packets and bulletins.</p>
<p>Data Storage</p>
<p><strong>Data Cards</strong> are the main method of mobile information storage and resemble modern-day smart cards. A data card resembles a credit card in size and shape but it iS more than a piece of plastic. The inside of a data card contains an embedded microprocessor. Data cards may have up to 1 gigabyte of RAM as well as a 16-bit microprocessor; they use a serial interface and receive their power from the card reader they are currently connected to. Their weight is negligible and their cost is $5 each.</p>
<p><strong>Optical Discs</strong> are used as a more powerful file storage platform and are also the central format for playing media (video and audio). The standard Baumann GmbH MiniDisk series holds up to 15.9 gigabytes of data and each glass disc is permanently mounted within a small, rectangular plastic case. The disc itself can withstand extreme temperatures and pressures and is predicted to hold its data internally for millennia. Their weight is negligible and their cost is $15 each.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Electronics</strong></p>
<p>There are a variety of small, personal electronics, but nothing comes close to the modern smart phone or tablet. There are digital cameras, as well as card readers and optical disc readers, for example, which are used for reading or editing data cards or watching videos, respectively. Beyond the portable terminal (the <strong>HOSTILE</strong> equivalent of the laptop) sits the memex, a single-use electronic data handling clipboard.</p>
<p><strong>Hosaka 4 Memex E-Board</strong>: A handy, clipboard-sized Model/0 terminal running administration and record-keeping software. It features a monochromatic screen with an in-built stylus. The memex is quite rugged, and it features a spring-loaded jack cable for plugging into any videofone unit that enables it to access the Network. It can plug into the Network physically and in a world like HOSTILE where wireless computing does not exist, the memex may play a much bigger role. Cops can use it to check in to HQ to search through mugshots or licence plates, small amounts of data can be downloaded by cable into the memex memory. Data cards are used to add more data to the functionality of the memex, and any accounts or records that the device creates can be stored on data card. Starship crews, courier firms and corporations around the world use the memex to record, track and confirm cargos and packages. Its record-keeping software is popular around the world, the memex even being used by the US Marines and other military services. This electronic clipboard ('e-board') weighs 2 kg and costs $250.</p></div>
