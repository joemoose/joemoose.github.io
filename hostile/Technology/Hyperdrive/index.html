<h1 id="hyperdrive">Hyperdrive</h1>
<p>Starships in the HOSTILE setting use type of hyperdrive. A hyperdrive does not have a maximum range instead, the ship's drive rating (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6) indicates the number of parsecs crossed per week of travel. Speeds are rated at 'parsecs per week'. Hyperdrives do not consume additional fuel, but use electrical power, therefore the ship's powerplant must equal or exceed the rating of the hyperdrive. A starship can remain in hyperspace until either its coolant or its life support needs replenishing.</p>
<h2 id="discovery-exploration">Discovery &amp; Exploration</h2>
<p>Faster than light travel is made possible by the discovery of a pseudo-dimension, one apparently co-existing with our own but possessing natural laws that are vastly different and for the most part void of scientific understanding. This altered reality was given several designations in the laboratory but is widely known simply as hyperspace, as plane of existence separate and yet coinciding with the natural universe. The discovery was the culmination of decades of research based on the original postulates established by Burkard Heim, who coined the phrase 'hyperspace' in the mid 20th century, as one of several additional dimensions, above and apart from the physical three and Einstein's fourth. Heim's Unified Quantum Field Principles On Electro-Gravitational Energy Conversion and later the work of Walter Droscher and his colleague Jochem Hauser would lead to a century of study and ongoing scientific experimentation. The eventual result was two major breakthroughs assisting mankind's exploration of space; artificial gravity and the hyperdrive.</p>
<p>The first 'hyperspace' breech was generated by Yana Shuli Hurtz, a professor at the Technion Institute in Haifa, Israel in 2103 during experiments directed at developing a method for the generation of artificial gravity. The initially unstable and potentially dangerous Paragravity Dynamo utilised a massive amount of electromagnetic radiation generated a from the spinning of a superconductor and temporarily stored within kilometres of superconducting coils. This energy was directed through contrabaric emitters to create a massive gravitomagnetic field initially in the 60-85 Tesla range. The field, although failing to produce the intended artificial-gravity results, instead propagated the first inter-dimensional breech. The effect was transient, with the unstable breech or shunt' collapsing immediately when interrupted by the presence of the Earth's own gravitational field but the implications were astounding. For 0.06 seconds the dynamo and its support structures had not produced gravity, they had ceased to exist. Where they had gone was a mystery but it spurred it an entirely new branch of scientific research, one that would dwarf the eventual benefits of artificial gravity.</p>
<p>Three years later (2106), at the Helstrom Research Laboratory on the asteroid Hygeia, working prototype of a hyperdrive was constructed, the experimental navigational equipment brought online and a series of performance tests begun. The first passengers to visit hyperspace were instrument packages and scientific apparatus, carried within the hull of the Red Shift III test vehicle as it engaged in a series of increasingly distant hyperspace 'jumps'. As the vessel was 'shunted' into the hyperspace breech it encountered a quantum tunnel effect which extended from the departure jump point to the preprogrammed arrival point somewhere ahead. Without a designated beginning and end to this hyper-dimensional conduit the breach simply closed after a few seconds, the tremendous electromagnetic radiation dissipating into space. When correctly configured however the tunnel not only enveloped the vessel but exposed it to a torrent of accelerated hyper-resonant 'ripples' in the tunnel's activity stream. These ripples propelled the vessel forward, through the tunnel, at an incredible yet non-Newtonian velocity. The vessel itself experienced no sign of this velocity, no sense of movement at all and its conventional engines lay dormant throughout, a natural acceleration driving her through hyperspace as a ship caught a in a strong current. The speed of this passage was dependent both on the mass of the vessel and the power of the 'shunt' generated as these factors correlated directly to the velocity induced by the resonant ripple effect.</p>
<p>Red Shift VII would have the distinction of successfully carrying the first human into and through hyperspace on June 28, 2106. The jump was only 135 million kilometers but the Red Shift (Christened 'Snark') arrived at the designated arrival point in only 6.4 minutes.</p>
<h2 id="effects-of-hyperspace">Effects of Hyperspace</h2>
<p>Snark's astounding feat marked man's freedom from the confines of his system of birth and the start of his race to the stars. Less advertised, however, was the condition of the flight's test pilot, US Navy Captain Michael Squires. Animal test subjects had been utilized in previous tests and they'd returned with alarming behavioural disorders. The physicians believed these side effects could be overcome by a human being's understanding of the bizarre experience and that they were for the most part the result of the subject's stress. They proved to be wrong however and eleven human pilots suffered horrendous mental and emotional disorders after their exposure before researchers proclaimed hyperspace unfit for conscious passengers. When subjected to the hyperspace environment while in cryosleep or it 'hypersleep' as it came to be called, travellers were unaffected by the neurosis and occasional coma-like symptoms experienced by the early test pilots. It became common protocol, therefore, to put passengers and crew into hypersleep and to assign monitoring duties on hyperspace voyages to the ship's computer or (on military craft) to an android.</p>
<p>Hyperspace itself appears as a vast, starless, and foreboding blackness, whatever light sources exist appear blue, shifting into invisible ultraviolet, except for directly in front and behind where the background microwave radiation in the path of the approaching ship blue shifts to the front and red shifts behind, providing a glowing, intensifying azure or magenta visual reference to the tunnelling phenomena at work.</p>
<p>Plotting a hyperspace run into the unknown, no matter how exacting the preliminary astronomical data, is incredibly dangerous and costly. Faster-Than-Light probes are sent out first to explore and map and then return with the data with which future hyperspace co-ordinates are plotted. These have to be very short trips however, the probes only jumping a fragment of a light year each time. Together with the analysis required it to establish jump coordinates, it takes many months to establish even a single light year hyperspace run to a new location. Because of this, all crews in known space are using established routes and the nav-routes they work on to prepare their journey are more or less modifications of the program for current celestial movements, etc. Navigators are basically updating the pre-plotted hyperspace routes with 'at the moment' specifics.</p>
<p>Within the ship the drain on even the most overpowered reactors is sufficient to leech power from most onboard systems so lights are dim, many tertiary systems and crew luxuries inoperable and the temperature uncomfortably cold, some inherent element of hyperspace leeching the heat even from a wide open reactor. When the hyperspace shunt opens a region of space roughly equal to the dimensions of the vessel, visually it blurs slightly then begins to glow blue from the localized light beginning to accelerate therein. A minute spark of flashing energy forms at the region's centre then expands in a vortex like pattern for a little over 2 seconds before dissipating in a sudden flash. When the light fades the vessel is gone. The reverse is true when an FTL vessel emerges only the ship's appearance is announced by a red-shift of approaching hyperspeed light and subsequent flash instead.</p>
<h2 id="hyperdrive-operating-parameters">Hyperdrive Operating Parameters</h2>
<p><strong>Apparent Velocity</strong>: A hyperdrive does not have a maximum range instead, the ship's drive rating (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6) indicates the number of parsecs crossed per week of travel. Speeds are rated at 'parsecs per week'. A drive rated '1' will take 7 weeks to get to a destination 7 parsecs away.
Fuel: Hyperdrives do not consume additional fuel, but use electrical power supplied by the ship's fusion reactor. Therefore ship's powerplant must equal or exceed the rating of the hyperdrive.</p>
<p><strong>Endurance</strong>: A drive can maintain its presence within the hyperspace tunnel indefinitely, it is limited only by the amount of coolant carried on board and the life support needs of the crew. Typically enough coolant is carried for 12 months of reactor operation, equal in displacement to the fusion reactor itself.</p>
<p><strong>Entering Hyperspace</strong>: Gravity and hyperspace have a very uneasy relationship, and entering hyperspace iS best done away from any major gravitational field (such as the system's star). Pre-existing hyperspace points (HSPs) have been charted in all explored star systems, all of which exist well beyond a star's habitable zone. The bigger the star the more luminous the star is) the further out these HSPs are. Hyperspace points are surveyed locations beyond a star's habitable zone, they are the perfect confluence ( gravity, dark matter, orbital mechanics and fluctuations through time that allow easy access to hyperspace. There are scores of HSPs in any one star system, each one is an invisible 'bubble' of 'hyperweak' space in the outer is system that is several thousands of kilometres in diameter.</p>
<p><strong>Leaving Hyperspace</strong>: Due to the serious risk of emerging within or adjacent to a large moon or planet, hyperspace jumps are by necessity terminated at pre-mapped, pre-surveyed hyperspace points within the destination star system. Starships emerge with the same velocity with which they entered hyperspace and on a preferred pre-planned course to the system's mainworld. It must decelerate to enter orbit around that world.</p>
<p><strong>Communications Within Hyperspace</strong>: FTL communications (both sending and receiving) using a hyperwave transceiver is possible both while the ship iS in hyperspace and when it is in 'real space'. Messages are brief (see next chapter, Communication).</p>
<p><strong>Sensor Operations</strong>: There are no sensors currently suitable for use in hyperspace. Distance travelled iS measured purely by reference to elapsed time and hyperdrive-calibrated frequency.</p>
<p><strong>Medical Effects of Hyperspace Exposure</strong>: Humans feel uncomfortable (see main text) if awake during hyperspace transit. In addition, roll 3+ on 2D6 each week to avoid a serious indefinite symptom (increase difficulty by +1, each week after that). The 6 most serious symptoms include amnesia, stupefaction, violent paranoia, tremors &amp; fits, self-harm, terrifying hallucinations.</p></div>
