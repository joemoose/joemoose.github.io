                <h1 id="communication">Communication</h1>
<p>There are five primary means of communications in use in the 23rd century.</p>
<p><strong>Hard Copy</strong>: A misnomer that has come to describe any form of dataholding object from a data-disk to a sheet of paper. The use of courier services to manually deliver such information is still popular, accompanying parcel delivery as a safe, albeit slow, alternative to other means of transfer.</p>
<p><strong>Fibre Optics</strong>: A direct hard-wired connection between communication devices is still the most prevalent method of distant communication on any world or vessel. Reliable and secure, a 'land line' avoids many of the pitfalls of wireless communications and is by far the more cost effective solution. Networks of fibre optics web every habitable zone and are capable of transferring massive amounts of data as well as video and audio communiques.</p>
<p><strong>Radio</strong>: Electromagnetic transfer of information is still a favourite form of communication in the universe.
Improvements to bandwidth, wavelength stability and transmitting power have kept this technology current, although larger equipment packages have become necessary to manage it. Despite the advances in signal strength, now capable of interplanetary distances, the radio wave is still limited by light speed and steadily degrading efficiency over distance. It remains however the preferred medium to broadcast audio and video as well as attached data bursts. Microwave based communications are still utilized but typically for secure, short-range transmissions only. They are particularly common in ground to orbit or inter-orbital comms. Maser sets are common equipment in any comm suite.</p>
<p><strong>Tight Beam Laser</strong> :Using lasers to carry information to a specific target is a highly secure and efficient, if expensive, medium. Capable of tremendous distance and pin point accuracy Free Space Optical Communication (FSOC) has been in use for century or more but has come into its own. Powerful carrier frequencies 'piggy backed' on laser emissions can deliver data packs and large memory caches at incredible speeds. A series of laser-linked satellites make the Integrated Data Network within well-travelled space possible.</p>
<p><strong>Hyperwave Transceivers</strong>: Faster-than-light communication exists, although it certainly is not instantaneous. All starships equipped with hyperdrive have FTL communication capability by default, as do most large outposts and colony worlds. The system requires a space-based hyperwave satellite to relay the signal from one star system to another it cannot be done from a planetary or moon surface. Typically an uplink tower sends the message up to the hyperwave satellite which then powers up to send it on its journey through hyperspace. As would be expected, these satellite relays are incredibly expensive and only the larger colony worlds with populations in the millions can afford to maintain more than one of them. Communication on the Network takes 1 parsec per day. Hyperwave bandwidth is small, allowing only a short burst of text (200 characters maximum; without spaces), much like an ancient telegram. Private use is very costly, the Network will charge you, your company or your colony administrator $50 per character (spaces are not charged). A 200 character message costs $10,000!</p>
<p>Utilizing hyperdrive methodology a hyperwave transceiver opens a minute nanosingularity hyperspace shunt and a transmits a isomodulated, narrow beam LnK2 (Link) laser through the tunnel. Similar to hyperspace navigation the carrier beam is configured to respond to hyper resonant ripple effects, speeding towards the plotted destination and breaching there, normally in proximity to another subspace satellite receiver. The message is then forwarded by conventional means on through whatever network is available. Hyperwave satellites are extremely expensive and maintenance intensive and only the most profitable or established locations can hope to be assigned on. The equipment is truly huge in scale with the In typical orbital transceiver weighing in at several tons and the dish measuring several dozen meters in diameter. These satellites are truly immense apparatus and require equally extensive support equipment. FTL capable vessels however are already equipped with the lion's share of the process and typically have a hyperwave transceiver as part of their communications suite. This module is linked to their hyperdrive and can facilitate FTL transmissions at a fraction of the energy cost and electronic complexity of a standalone unit.</p>
<p>The relay system of the Network is operated by the United Corporate Combine and is more formally known as the Integrated Data Network. It is headquartered on the Earth's Moon. The Network operates a small a fleet of platform support vessels that it uses to deploy new satellites, repair or decommission old ones and to ferry personnel from site to site. The organization is also tasked with scanning local star systems for communications, and is particularly concerned with distress signals from both civilian and military starships.</p>
<h2 id="starship-communications">Starship Communications</h2>
<p>Standard comm suites on spacecraft, orbital platforms and both space-based and planetary installations allow for radio and free-space optical laser communications system wide. Radio transmitters are capable of narrow and broadband transmissions while laser communication rigs require precise target location data to connect. Trafficked systems incorporate FSOC linked satellite networks to facilitate regular comms while almost any orbital body of corporate or governmental interest is seeded with a few communication satellites. Commercial com gear permits operations on a number of approved frequencies and emergency bands while restricted frequencies are utilized by military and private entities. All such comm traffic is of course at light-speed only with the associated delays at interplanetary distances.</p>
<h2 id="videophones">Videophones</h2>
<p>In the <strong>HOSTILE</strong> setting, the revolution in communications wasn't the cellphone, but the videophone. There are videophones in cars, on office desks, in bars and clubs, railway stations and airports, space stations, starship corridors and apartments. And of course they exist in public phone booths, too. But don't think that these phones are all simply dial-and-talk interfaces, most can also accept data cards. Some of these are business cards that, when slotted into the phone, ring the employee at the business automatically.</p>
<h2 id="the-retro-radio">The Retro-Radio</h2>
<p>Instrumentation is typical of the technology of the time. Cathode screens, manual key boards, toggles, rotary knobs, dials and switches are prominent with hand held receivers, microphones and wall mounted intercom panels the norm. Readouts are backlit indicators and needle deflection gauges. Hard copy printers are common place, providing printed format message translation or performance analysis. Quality of audio or visual communications is highly dependent on signal strength but in general is moderate to poor, with the quality of the receiving display equipment potentially degrading quality further. This is especially true in space applications. Transmission of teletype hard copy written messages is an ongoing and popular alternative as signal strength requirements are minimal and even outdated equipment reliable that mode.</p>
