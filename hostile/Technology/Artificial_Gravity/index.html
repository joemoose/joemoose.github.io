    <h1 id="artificial-gravity">Artificial Gravity</h1>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>Developed almost simultaneously with Faster-Than-Light (FTL) travel, early research in artificial gravity actually spurred progress in that related field but found success itself only after embracing fundamental changes in design theory. The eventual result, after nearly a decade of experimentation and countless programme failures was an operating graviton generator. The Faraday Primary Induction Emitter (FPIE), as it was first coined after Michael Faraday, originator of electromagnetic theory in the 1800s, utilized a superconducting stator and ultra hi-speed electromagnetic induction rotor suspended in a cylinder of pressurized ladium gas. Together they produced a localized but powerful gravimetric field using controlled angular accelerations with a correlation factor of a modest 0.94G. The effect was a steady a stream of gravitons emanating from the stator which were then repolarized and shaped into singular linear projection. When trapped between pair of field matrices a short-ranged non-Newtonian gravitational effect was induced.</p>
<p>This effect was limited, the field reaching only a or 4 meters and displaying a hard cap of 1.022157 standard Earth gravities. However, when confronted with counter gravitational or inertial energy the matrix repolarized, inverted the counter energy's potential and was able to, in effect, nullify this influence to a much higher 6G to 8G threshold. The dreams of gravimetric drives, tractor-beams and anti-gravity lifts were dashed, such marvels relegated to future projects perhaps after years of research but the Faraday Emitter in its current state proved perfect for two critical applications. When properly calibrated the emitters provided comfortable gravity aboard ship and could to some extent counter the effects of acceleration/deceleration on the crew when linked to the ship's accelerometers.</p>
<h2 id="artificially-induced-gravity-assembly">Artificially Induced Gravity Assembly</h2>
<p>After barely 18 months of initial trials, Faraday Primary Induction Emitters and their corresponding graviton field matrices (together named an Artificially Induced Gravity Assembly or AIGA) were being included in the design of almost every new spacecraft and were being retrofitted into hundreds of older models as well. Polytarizine capacitors were soon added to all extant models that maintained gravitational control for several hours in the event of power loss but no solution was immediately forthcoming to avoid 'Damper Lag'. This brief period of unsettling and sometimes dangerous unprotected inertial reaction occurred during the first few seconds of a marked inertial change as the dampening field adjusted. A number of accidents lead to standard operating procedures requiring all personnel to be strapped in during manoeuvres. This prevails today.</p>
<p>Space travellers could, with the newly developed Artificially Induced Gravity Assemblies (AIGAs) systematically placed throughout the vessel, operate without the rigors of zero-G and better endure the stresses of high G manoeuvring. The improvement to the safety and efficiency of space operations was dramatic, although the equipment was still optional however and expensive. Small orbital transfer vehicles, shuttles, military attack craft and many semi-automated ships with limited crew service areas endured or utilized established counter methods such as spin-habitats, vectored thrust gravity, accelerator couches and pharmaceutical hightolerance regimes. The AIGA technology was improving however and few doubted it would replace such measures within a generation. On all big ships, AIGA a technology, providing a comfortable 1G approximate environment, is standard.</p>
<p>The AIGA generators that house the FPIEs (each roughly the size of a refrigerator) are a fitted on each deck in a symmetrical layout, each with an accompanying spider web of graviton matrices woven throughout the hull decking. Larger ships would require more generators, certainly at least three per deck but perhaps one per large section as well. Sections requiring their own Artificially Induced Gravity Assemblies might include Command, Crew Services, Engineering, Crew Quarters, Lab and Medical, Cargo Area, etc. The limitation is that a matrix must be installed above and beneath the area of artificial gravity. Outdoor basketball games on G zero G worlds or on the exterior hull of the ship are not feasible!</p>
