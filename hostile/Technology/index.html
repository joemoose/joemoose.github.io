                <h1 id="technology">Technology</h1>
<p>Look at those cathode-ray tube monitors in Alien and Outland, marvel at the lack of flat-screen technology, touch-screen computers, cell-phones and a hundred other modern marvels. Why aren't they in that setting? How do we rationalize a future, some two centuries hence, where cell-phones, plasma screens and wi-fi just don't exist?</p>
<h2 id="an-alternate-future">An Alternate Future</h2>
<p>As in our current time, technology in the <strong>HOSTILE</strong> setting looked on the verge of a virtual electronics developmental explosion as the 1970s gave way to the 1980s but a series of seemingly minor circumstances and major historical events hampered what might have been a wondrous new age and changed the course of human history. As President George Bush gave his now famous Space Exploration Initiative speech on July 20, 1989 and launched an enterprise that would send mankind out into the solar system and beyond, there were already factors affecting the technologies that would take them there.</p>
<h2 id="the-decline-of-moores-law">The Decline of Moore's Law</h2>
<p>Moore's Law is "the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years." In April 2005, Gordon Moore stated that the projection cannot be sustained indefinitely: "It can't continue forever. The nature of exponentials is that you push them out and eventually disaster happens." The ongoing miniaturization and improvement of integrated circuits therefore slowed dramatically as the 20th century came to a close. Dreams of micro-electronic components and palm-sized super computers crashed as improvements in computer technology were slaved to large main-frame processors and bulky terminals. Now, mechanical and electrical engineering would have to take up the slack and become the main agent of technological progress.</p>
<h2 id="network-insecurities">Network Insecurities</h2>
<p>Rampant security breaches and the hacking of civilian, commercial, industrial and governmental data networks cost those affected billions and on more than one occasion threatened world-wide economic collapse. As a result a compartmentalizing and decentralization of databanks was instituted as well as a shift from risky wireless connectivity to a more secure hard-wire format. Transmitted data, when necessary for a given application, was sent by tight-beam data-burst or secure carrier frequencies.</p>
<p>While wireless networks are common today, in the retrofuture of the <strong>HOSTILE</strong> setting such technology is just too risky. Wireless networks can be too easily spied on, jammed and spoofed, etc. This makes a smartphone full of personal information a liability, not an asset. The open trading of computer files on a network is not something that the governments, corporations, or other organizations support. There is an increased reliability on material memory disks instead of virtual data storage as a high-security means of data management. If someone buys or sells music, video, or software, it's typically In person with a disc, not via the network. Network engineers, hackers, and technicians may use a computer tied into a network, but the average person does not, except to use email or videophones.</p>
<h2 id="the-flight-926-incident">The Flight 926 Incident</h2>
<p>On May 12th, 2029 an Emirates Boeing 777 exploded just off the cost of Qatar en-route to Cairo. The 1.7 megaton nuclear device vaporized the 378 passengers and crew, contaminated thousands with far-spreading fallout, and devastated the region's power grid and electrical services for months. Long term casualty estimates were nightmarish and the effect on petroleum production and trade from the EMP alone was a universal calamity. The radical religious zealots responsible for the tragedy were identified and brought to justice but the effects of the disaster were far reaching. The vulnerability of solid state technology to EMP emissions on such a wide scale prompted a manufacturing frenzy towards more secure, EMP resistant and dependable alternatives. The resulting technology succeeded in these aims but at a cost of performance, power requirements and most of all size.</p>
<p>The revolution began a design and developmental trend that would see heavier, bulkier and sturdier electronic devices in every application and a closer symmetry with mechanical alternatives. The limited but still catastrophic East Asian Nuclear conflict in 2047 only served to entrench the need for such an institutional shift and established manufacturing principles for the next century.</p>
<h2 id="development-of-the-vacuum-channel-transistor">Development of the Vacuum Channel Transistor</h2>
<p>At the onset of the 21st century, NASA engineers tinkered with an odd new technology, the Vacuum Channel Transistor (VCT) which was essentially a high-tech a version of the old vacuum tube that had been all but made extinct by the onset of solid state electronics in the 60s. The VCT utilized a field-emission principle and was faster, more powerful and lacked many of the vulnerabilities of its electronic rivals including operation at high temperatures and tolerance to high dose radiation. When coupled with developments in carbon nanotube heat transfer the new technology sparked a subtle revolution as processing operating frequencies in the terahertz range became possible. The answer to the failing solid state market had been found with one major disadvantage. VCT technology was bulky and heavy and required additional supportive hardware that ended the steady migration to smaller and lighter electronics that had dominated for decades. The future of electronics would be bright and unimaginably efficient, but it would be big.</p>
<h2 id="design-paradigm">Design Paradigm</h2>
<p>As a result of the previous events and other lesser factors electronic design and development in the <strong>HOSTILE</strong> setting took a decidedly different direction to our own. As man took his first major steps into space and Earth embraced the challenges of the new century the tools, vehicles and devices they held dear took on a new dimension, one formed by the nature of their construction.</p>
<p>Solid and well-made was the new design format. Perhaps heavy and unwieldy by the standards of the late 20th century, the new designs were simply accepted as a matter of need, and embraced as the next generation of electronics. Style followed purpose and as the decades passed the new 'industrial' appeal became common place. A certain, popular, 'retro-tech' trend spread throughout the world's key manufacturers and design choices were quick to reflect it. Chic, streamlined, stylish consumer electronics in glass and minimalist-style cases were never popular, gaining the instant reputation as cheap toys, gimmicks and gifts. Consumers wanted their equipment to look like it was up to the job, and so the mantra went: "if it looked right then it was right!" Patterns of construction emerged and the manufacturing climate took on a distinct, workaday tone. Electronic development vaulted ahead and with the space-race fulling innovation, technology enjoyed a new renaissance but snuggly within the blueprint set by those early years of re-innovation. Mechanical contrivance rivalled the electronic for the first time in decades and the offspring of the two would carry human kind to the stars.</p>
<p>Mechanical alternatives to electronic applications were popularized and control schemes returned to concepts thought to be on the way out. Buttons, dials and toggle switches replaced touch screens and keyboard commands while gauges and meters took the place of multi-purpose LCD screens and computer based monitoring. Pneumatics and hydraulics surged ahead of magnetic engineering as cost effective and efficient alternatives to the now almost as bulky electronic versions. Engines once dominated by computerized regulation were designed with auto-mechanical management instead, increasing performance and reliability but size and weight as well. Almost forgotten elements of modern society driven out decades earlier by modern tech were here and there revived.</p>
<h2 id="retro-engineering">Retro-Engineering</h2>
<p>Following a world-wide trend manufacturers and developers began designing and building with larger, heavier and mechanically domineering elements to offset the decline of micro-electronics. Servos, motors, ventilation equipment, pumps, coolant and heating, engines, batteries, power generation, product delivery lines and every component in modern engineering began to take on this initially subtle but increasingly imposing aspect. Solid-state construction principles gave way to a combination of new bold electronics and mechanical engineering converting the once minute and fragile to sturdy and imposing devices.
Hydraulic and pneumatic equipment is everywhere, replacing electric motors in many applications. Motorized power equipment, run by internal combustion motors or separate generators is also prevalent with many industrial applications perpetually accompanied by the hum, drone or rumble of a supporting motor. Electrical lines are larger, thicker and carry more current and many more are necessary for a single a application. Manually powered back up provisions are also plentiful with crankcapacitors, hand pumped hydraulics and the like present on most critical equipment. The structures built to support this technology are heavier, industry grade designs, sporting massive frames, thick insulating material, extensive venting and sizeable access spaces. Lighting is sparse, inefficient and often unreliable. Confined to outdated construction methods fluorescent, Zenon and even incandescent fixtures still predominate with LEDS and other advanced lighting equipment left behind with the transistor. The pale luminescence of back lit readouts and instrumentation are often accompanied only by the flicker of a failing fluorescent overhead.</p>
<p>In general the electrical and mechanical technology of the 22nd century and beginning of the 23rd resembles that of the heavy industrial construction prevalent in the late 20th in most respects, despite enjoying the developmental improvements in principle and function of the years that followed. This is as much a feature of necessity and purpose as it is one of style and custom. There were clear reasons for the shift in the beginning but after a generation design followed design and as the decades passed new trends followed old ones without any clear motivation to change and every reason to build on established methods.</p>
<p>Off-World </p>
<p>Needs While the retrofuture of the <strong>HOSTILE</strong> setting makes certain specific stylistic choices in a nod to the source material from which it takes its inspiration, it is a game largely focused on the lives of workers, explorers, and space-farers in the regions of space far from Earth. That IS, on life off-world. This is an incredibly difficult environment for computers and electronics, which might be exposed to radiation, solar flares, gravity fluctuations, and other elements of utterly alien environments. Silica, dust, methane gas, or thousand other substances could ruin a machine in a matter of minutes or even seconds. The gadgets need to operate in the most unforgiving environments that humans will encounter. This means that the equipment used offworld needs to be 'over-engineered' in comparison to electronics on Earth. While a citizen of Tokyo might enjoy comparatively light and handy consumer electronics, the platform workers on Tau Ceti will have little use for such items.</p>
<p>Off-world devices are, above all, robust, easy to use, and easy to repair. If a critical device breaks it could cause injuries or even deaths. Heavy cabling, thick cases, and simple displays are the name of the game. If everything looks like it belongs in an industrial setting it that's because it does! Likewise, the software and repair support for consumer electronics iS just not available. Smartphones and their apps may be ubiquitous in 2018, but in a distant colonial world without easy connectivity and the servers and upgrades to keep them working, such devices are all but useless, and mostly unnecessary. Old fashioned, hard-wired phones work perfectly fine, even when the electromagnetic environment would block a cell phone call. Better to have a powerful backpack radio or satellite link that can reach across a continent, even during a thunderstorm or ionospheric flare-up, than a tiny pocket radio that needs an expensive radio tower network to carry i message.</p>
