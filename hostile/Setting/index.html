<h2 id="recent-past">Recent Past</h2>
<p>Mankind explored and colonized the solar system throughout the 21st century and by 2100 many planets and moons were home to outposts and mining stations. The nations of Earth had over-reached themselves, however, and much of the cost of the space effort was tendered out to Southern Cross Mining. Likewise, Luna had divested itself of the burden of maintaining mining outposts and space colonies, offering the enterprises to the Reiner-Gamma Corporation.</p>
<p>Within a decade or two Earth and Luna were politically united, but the human race was under an immense population and resource pressure. Reiner-Gama soon swallowed up Southern Cross and dominated the solar system, supplying petroleum and minerals to Earth at any price it chose. The other, major /corporations of Earth put their faith in a new breakthrough, the quantum hyperspace tunnelling effect, and after the first hyperspace ship returned from Alpha Centauri in 2120, were soon building ships able to scout out resources in neighbouring star systems. We had a Faster-Than-Light drive!</p>
<h2 id="the-first-recession-2166-2170">The First Recession [2166-2170]</h2>
<p>After the creation of an interstellar drive, a scramble for the stars ensued as mining and oil drilling companies desperately sought out resources that they could supply to Earth thereby skirting Reiner-Gama's near monopoly within the Solar System. Within thirty years there were twenty flourishing colonies within parsecs of Earth and dozens of small outposts and mining installations.</p>
<p>On Earth, stresses were beginning to show within the world government of the Earth Union. The Chinese Communist Party initiated greatly-needed and wide-ranging reforms but these could not stem the economic and social problems that had piled up over the past four decades. In 2166 the Communist Party was abolished and amid political turmoil a new, more democratic government, was established. Earth, tied intimately into the Chinese economy was plunged into the First Recession, the world government reacted poorly, and lost the confidence of many nations. China broke apart, just as the Earth Union itself collapsed. Manchuria successfully seceded from the 'new' China to create the People's Republic of Guandong. Various autonomous regions in the far west, including Tibet and Xinjiang, followed suit. The economic heartland of China, the wealthy and well populated east coast styled itself as the Federal Republic of China. The chaos lasted for a decade, and within that time of uncertainty and of a shrinking China, Japan and its powerful corporations stepped up.</p>
<p>Japan had itself undergone social and economic transformation starting twenty years earlier, and had tackled systemic problems of an aging population, a shrinking population and a reliance on foreign raw materials. With controlled immigration from within the Asia-Pacific region, and renewed focus on automation, robotics and artificial intelligence technologies to increase productivity, Japan was looking boldly into the future. As China entered its time of crisis and First Recession began to bite, Japan was able to show leadership in the region and formed the Asia Pacific Partnership in an attempt to weather the storm. China had lost its lead in the region Japan once again dominated the Far Eastern area.</p>
<p>In 2170 the major corporations of the world came together in Singapore to create the United Corporate Combine essentially a standing inter-corporate council. The Combine's first task was to establish agencies which would regulate international business and practices, something the United Nations had once done, and that the Earth Union had then continued. The Earth Union had ceased to exist in all but name two years earlier at the height of the First Recession. Corporations now seemed to wield the most power on and off of Earth, and their 'voters' were their customers. Nations relied on these industrial giants for both their valuable business and their lucrative investments.</p>
<h2 id="the-second-recession-2200-2215">The Second Recession (2200-2215)</h2>
<p>The nations of Earth would need these resources, as, in 2200, the oil reserves dried up (or at least became unprofitable to exploit). Oil was desperately needed, not for fuel, since most vehicles ran from hydrogen fuel cells and power-stations were fusion-based and required helium-3. Petroleum was needed by the plastics and the chemicals industries. Bioplastic was n use, but its reliance on vegetable matter grown in fields that could otherwise be used to feed starving millions, meant that oil, tried and tested over centuries and understood by all chemical engineers and plant designers, remained the primary choice. Now oil reserves on distant moons and on harsh planets would have to provide a source for that oil.</p>
<p>The Oil Crisis of 2200 initiated a Second Recession lasting for 15 years. Some colonies and outposts were temporarily abandoned due to cost-saving exercises. In Macapa, Brazil, an extraordinary construction was begun: a vast oil pipeline stretching from the surface all the way to the edge of the atmosphere and beyond out to a distant orbit. This Trans Atmospheric Petroleum Pipeline (TAPP) was funded by a unique corporate consortium for the Community of American States. it was a statement: 'once this pipeline is completed the recession will end. And end it did. Oil flowed, prices dropped, economies began to flourish and a new era began in human history.</p>
<p>The colonization of space was not some great altruistic project, an attempt to 'spread humanity across the stars' or to 'explore the unknown', it was all about profit. No nation could justify such an undertaking, and SO the corporations sought their profits out there on asteroids and icy moons, on planets good and bad. Mineral extraction, logging and oil drilling were the big industries in space and a vast infrastructure of tugs, space stations, cargo starships, spaceports and terminals was constructed.</p>
<h2 id="insurrection-on-tau-ceti-2215-present">Insurrection on Tau Ceti (2215-Present)</h2>
<p>Colonies were established, mostly within parsecs of Earth, but these large-scale settlements today typically service the extraction industries operating out toward the Outer Rim and beyond. Most serve as way stations and technical bases for the large corporations and their space enterprises. The oldest of the Off-World colonies, Tau Ceti, has been plunged into war during the past decade.</p>
<p>The planet had been settled separately by two nations: China and the United States of America, but with the fall of China during the First Recession, the Chinese colony was abandoned. Only after the recession did brutal counter-insurgency war on Tau Ceti begin factions supported by the new competing Chinese nations struggled to capture Shulin, the Chinese colony. When the UCC ruled that only independence for Tau Ceti (both American and Chinese colonies) would end the crisis, the United States was invited to act as peacekeeper within the Chinese colony, until a stable government could be formed and independence for Tau Ceti organized. From that moment in 2215, the Chinese factions turned on the American peacekeepers with great ferocity.
The USA has gotten embroiled in a savage counter-insurgency that is costing thousands of lives every year and trillions of dollars annually. Washington cannot let the Chinese colony fail, to do so would endanger the safety and security of the successful American colony, Lindbergh, on the same world. With the Chinese and American colonies both united and independent, the USA would have a strong and powerful pro-American ally in the Near Earth Zone.</p>
<h2 id="eco-collapse">Eco Collapse</h2>
<p>The impact of ten billion people and their high technology lifestyles had a great impact on planet Earth, and then of course there has been the effect of global warming a fact, no matter what its source. The late 22nd century saw rising sea levels, droughts and rampant desertification, with millions of hectares of farmland being lost to the encroaching sand dunes. Climates began a permanent shift; large parts of the United States, for example, have become hot, almost rainless and dry.</p>
<p>A blistering sun kills crops in the fields and scorching winds blow in desert sands to cover them over. Many American cities suffer from water shortages making life hard for the poorest in society. Expert water management in North America has prevented this climatic shift from becoming a agricultural catastrophe, however, and intensive farming can still continue to feed the people in the cities.
While America and Europe bravely struggle to stave off total eco-collapse, there are many nations that have failed. Kyrgyzstan has been thoroughly 'desertified', as has Mali, Chad and the Sonoran region of Mexico.</p>
<p>Many American cities are dry and dusty; a bourbon-colored haze fills the air, cutting visibility to only a few miles. On bad days only the tops of distant skyscrapers and arcologies can be seen rising up above the orange-brown smog. 'You don't have to go to other stars to find a planet where the atmosphere is trying to kill you,' said senator Terry Enderman, famously. 'The air above L.A. is as nasty as it gets. Drop a 21st century Angelino in here and I bet they'd classify it as "alien".'</p>
<p>Today the corporations are all-mighty; they wield power and budgets that dwarf many nations on Earth. And much of their power comes from their role as suppliers of petroleum, helium-3, minerals and other raw materials to an ever-hungry (and ever growing) population. Reiner-Gama has claimed by force much of the solar system as a corporate preserve, and it continues to supply Earth with valuable raw materials • at a price. But competition from the off-world mining and drilling colonies has increased year-by-year.</p></div>
