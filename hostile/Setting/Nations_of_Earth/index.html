    <h1 id="nations-of-earth">Nations of Earth</h1>
<p>Political instability on Earth toppled the world government that had kept the peace for half a century, now the biggest players on the global stage are three political blocs, each led by strident and powerful nation. These alliances are:</p>
<h2 id="community-of-american-states-cas">Community of American States (CAS)</h2>
<p>This includes most of the nations of North and South America, and includes Britain. It is dominated and led by the United States of America. The CAS is a massive power bloc and has access to numerous space-launch facilities as well as the incredible Trans-Atmospheric Petroleum Pipeline that transfers off-world oil from starships arriving from distant planets.</p>
<h2 id="western-european-union-weu">Western European Union (WEU)</h2>
<p>This trans-national entity once existed in the 1960's and 1970's and was re-established around sixty years ago. It's ancient predecessor, the European Union, dissolved in the early 21st century. The Western European Union is a tight, German-dominated circle of high-tech, western European neighbours.</p>
<h2 id="asia-pacific-partnership-app">Asia-Pacific Partnership (APP)</h2>
<p>Following China's collapse and balkanization during the First Recession, Japan was ready to step up to lead the nervous nations of East Asia. The chaos and economic uncertainty of the recession helped to pull Japan's neighbours into that country's powerful orbit. Tokyo now rules most of East Asia through this Asia-Pacific Partnership. Raw materials and skilled migrants flow into resurgent Japan, whilst exported goods flow out to the other nations of the APP. Of the three Chinese splinter states, only the Federation of China (the industrialized eastern seaboard of China) has refused to join the APP.</p>
<h2 id="historical-precidents">Historical Precidents</h2>
<p>The alliances are similar in nature to the trans-national groups of the 21st century; entities like the Arab League, ASEAN, the Commonwealth of Independent States, NAFTA and others. But the difference here is the lack of an equal say terrible shocks in the global economy and aggressive threats of war by some large nations, forced smaller nations to seek the patronage of the biggest and most powerful. These powerhouses now dominate the alliances that they are (ostensibly) equal members of, but their actual power is magnified greatly by the loyalty and fealty of the other nations within the union. In the CAS, for example, US military forces conduct peacekeeping forces inside war-torn member states, and US-based corporations enjoy significant benefits within the alliance. Member nations of the blocs are still mostly free and independent, yet many have become almost dependencies of their powerful patron. A similar arrangement existed during the First Cold War, when Soviet Russia presided over a Warsaw Pact of ostensibly free sovereign nations.</p>
