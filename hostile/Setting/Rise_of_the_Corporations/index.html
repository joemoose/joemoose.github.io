    <h1 id="rise-of-the-corporations">Rise of the Corporations</h1>
<p>While the Earth become more disunited, the corporations found that they had many things in common and were forced to find ways to arbitrate the many disputes and trade deals that had previously gone through the world government. In 2170 the United Corporate Combine (the UCC, or simply 'Combine') was established. It is a permanent council for arbitration and corporate law that was established by the major corporations to handle matters of international and interstellar law. It manages several offices which focus on specific areas, including the Mining Regulation Commission (MRC), the Interstellar Commerce Organization (ICO) and the Extra-Solar Colonization Administration (ESDA).</p>
<p>Several of Earth's corporations are extremely powerful; like the nations that they feed from, many have abandoned public shareholdings. The most powerful are privately owned, run by families and clans. Each corporation is comprised of multiple companies with robust internal transactions, all controlled by a single, near all-powerful chairman that acts both as manager and de-facto owner of the entire enterprise. Each is vertically organized, with manufacturing, supply, finance and banking, and distribution all in-house. Sub-companies are created to run these sectors and benefit the umbrella organization.</p>
<p>The bank and general trading company sit at the heart of the corporation. Typical concerns of a corporation are banking, insurance, steel, trading, manufacturing, electronics, gas and power, chemical and interstellar development and ship-building. The general trading company (the heart) concerns itself with logistics, plant development, and both international and interstellar resource exploration. These corporations trade in many markets (or diversify) for security, and all the component companies own shares in one another's companies, thus preventing hostile take-overs, allowing the monitoring and disciplining of firms and easing pressure on management, allowing the corporation to focus on long-term goals.</p>
<p>These 23nd century corporations resemble the South Korean <em>chaebol</em> and the Japanese <em>keiretsu</em> of the 21st century, both of which formed in the post-war world of the 1950s. All the corporations have plenty of power on Earth amongst the political blocs, and everyone knows that if they fail, they bring the global economies down with them. Many politicians are also sponsored by these corporations. They are powerful: who regulates a transnational company if not a transnational body that is transparent and responsive to global stakeholders? Such a body does not exist. The UN was disbanded long-ago.</p>
<h2 id="the-big-seven">The Big Seven</h2>
<p>Many of Earth's corporations are extremely powerful, often rivaling in economic power the nations that they feed from. The most powerful are conglomerates. A conglomerate is a corporation that is made up of a number of different, seemingly unrelated businesses.</p>
<p>On near-future Earth, the corporations are master. Every important or well-paid or job here is within such a mega-corporation. A vast percentage of jobs are either in these corporations or one of their subsidiaries or suppliers. Their employees, shareholders and pensioners are at the top of society. Below them are the independent businessmen and other professionals who deal regularly with the corporation and are on good terms with them. To be outside the corporate structure means a wretched life in a Development Zone struggling for a living, with no regular income, no medical or security insurance and no credit.</p>
<p>The biggest entities are the vast conglomerates; each a related family of corporations. The "Big Seven" are:</p>
<p><strong>Leyland-Okuda Erebus</strong>: Built on an engineering pedigree, Leyland-Okuda is rapidly diversifying. Based in Dubai.</p>
<p><strong>Erebus</strong>: Growing to power on Antarctic oil, this British-based conglomerate continues to focus on resource extraction.</p>
<p><strong>Voroncovo</strong>: Based on high-tech companies and on security, this Russian conglomerate has since branched out.</p>
<p><strong>Wu-Ketai</strong>: The most powerful of the Asia Pacific conglomerates, Wu-Ketai owns some of the best technical brands.</p>
<p><strong>Reiner-Gama</strong>: Although its mining and oil drilling operations are restricted to the Solar System, Reiner-Gama constructs key components for the aerospace industry.</p>
<p><strong>Tharsis</strong>: Once a Martian conglomerate, Tharsis is now US-based and active in all fields. Its chairman is 223 year-old Compton de Vaille.</p>
<p><strong>Matsuyama</strong>: This Japanese conglomerate has a number of successful defense corporations, but is also known for colonial development and genetic products.</p>
