All are part of a conglomerate, but will still appear in RPG scenarios as patrons, antagonists, allies or obstacles. This list is not iS exhaustive, but merely representative of the types of corporations trading in 2350. Ellis-Itami Ellis-Itami is an information corporation and feared for that. It seems to have an unprecedented data network. E-I owns insurance subsidiaries, a detective agency, stock traders, several small Japanese banking companies, and Kodai-Secure, the famous courier and security firm. Information is Ellis-Itami's game, and the business leadership has a reputation for hiring the brightest cyberspace cowboys and the best investigators. Trying to be impartial, they sell all data to all corporations, all governments: everyone. Much feared is the E-I credit section hired by other firms to collect debts. These 'repo men' are basically hired guns, ronin and street scum. Haruna Biolabs This corporation deals in medical services, drugs and genetic treatments. Haruna previously did some bio-weapons designs for the Japanese Self Defence Force but this was stopped when the viral agent Delta-2 contaminated food supplies, water and some areas back in the early 23rd century. Many deaths ensued, but no one was ever certain who was actually responsible. The government blamed a radical terrorist group called the Imperial Restoration League. Haruna, for its part, suspects Makita Genetics of trying (in vain) to discredit Haruna and win the military contract for itself. In mutual fear, both corporations are at a virtual full-scale war. The people of Tokyo and the Asia Pacific Partnership are bracing themselves for further violence. Haruna's network of clinics and hospitals are run by a subsidiary called Life Corp. Haruna has spent almost a century at the forefront of human genetics research, perfecting vat-grown organs tailored for a specific donor, and specializing in genetic treatments. In the last two years, however, Los Angeles-based Haruna has become known for its high-end human cloning program. Immortality has been discovered through the perpetual cloning of one's own body and the transfer of one's own living memories into a new, virile body. It is quite legal to purchase a Clone Insurance Policy of $20,000 per month. It involves visiting one of Haruna's high-end clinics and providing tissue samples ready for cloning when the customer dies. The customer also provides an initial memory recording which costs an additional $50,000 and is kept in a Superconducting Memory Unit (SMU). These are bulky machines kept in sub-zero basements that always self-erase whenever they play someone's memories into their clone body. Updates are free. When a Haruna customer dies, the company picks up his body (or head at the very least) and takes the last recording of the corpse's memories if possible, for implanting it into the clone that is being force-grown. Growing a clone to full maturity (around 30 years old) takes one month and requires a valid death certificate in order to prevent cloning someone still alive which is a gross criminal act in international law. The new clone is the original person in international law. A force-grown clone that does not have a memory transferred into it is illegal. The clone has no memories at all, no emotions, and is psychologically unstable. It creates its own emotional reactions that can be very dangerous. In 2209, activists broke into the Munich headquarters of the company and exposed the fact that memory-less clones were being created purely to supply replacement organs for their VIP donors. Several hundred memory-less clones escaped and most of those have not yet been recaptured or terminated. This Munich Uprising is described later in the section (see Lebkuchen). Since that embarrassing fiasco in 2209, Haruna has developed the Superconducting Memory Unit and perfected its legitimate, legal and potentially very profitable clone replacement program. Policyholders are few at the moment, mainly due to cost and the stigma that still surrounds the Munich Uprising. Kinako Food is in short supply in 2350. Ten billion people are hungry and little enough land exists to feed them all on the diets that have typically served Mankind. So runs the Kinako advertising\u2014the corporation has revolutionized agriculture with genetically-modified soya to create four distinct, diverse and very different eating experiences. In essence, kinako yellow, kinako green, kinako brown and kinako red can be formed into the likeness of many different types of recognisable foodstuffs. It is on the menu of supermarkets, restaurants and starship canteens throughout human space. Kinako is a giant amongst food retailers and also produces soft drinks, alcohol, consumer goods and household items. Red Dragon Beer A decent beer is hard to come by especially in the Outer Rim. Don't get left out in the Cold. Red Dragon beer\u2014be a part of it. If you're in space, you drink Red Dragon that's just going to be a fact. You may get hold of L-4 Lager when the Dragon runs out, but when it's back in stock, you pop the cap and sip that taste of home. Makita Genetics A market leader in genetics and the creator of Retrogenics\u2122, the science of retroactively splicing and force-growing animal or engineered DNA into a host. Retrogenics technology is experimental and not licenced for use on humans. The chairman of Makita is the mysterious Taneo Tomita, a virtual recluse in the Tokyo Sky Tower that serves as the corporation's global headquarters. The corporation spends a great deal on its public image and the corp is seen as the first of a new kind of company that could change the world and the destiny of the human race purely through genetics. The company has incorporated several medical companies including Alcor, the 1970s cryogenics firm. Makita made the cryonics breakthrough that now allows full-body freezing (or 'stasis') using the now ubiquitous hypersleep chamber. Makita's rival is Haruna Biolabs. Nortinghouse Nortinghouse has been building nuclear reactors since the days of the Cold War, back in the 1950s. It worked with NASA on various nuclear thermal rocket designs in the 1970s and helped to kick-start the revolution in space transportation almost a hundred years later with its gas core reactor designs. Constantly in competition with smaller, newer firms, Nortinghouse is an adaptable and energetic corporation, reinventing its self constantly. It not only produces good quality fusion reactors but also solar cells, life support systems, plasma rocket systems, space suits and even something as humble as zero-G power tools. Nortinghouse is the epitome of reliability. Parkfield Biolabs Parkfield's operations include agri-chemicals, genetics, biocides and pesticides. Its HQ is in Toronto and its CEO is James Parkfield Jnr. Parkfield owns a large Canadian Agri-Corp specialising in genetic manipulation to produce genetically superior crops and associated crop enhancers. Parkfield owns huge areas of farmable land in Canada, Brazil, and Russia. The corporation's main laboratory ('Rockwell') is situated in a mountain-side complex that extends deep into the Rocky Mountains. There is some speculation that the complex is responsible for many of the more accessible synthetic street drugs. Star Envoy Club The Star Envoy Club is a Hong Kong-based organization that aims to make interstellar travel as bearable (or as the club says 'enjoyable') as possible for its members. It is most often used by corporate executives and other wealthy businessmen who are the only people who can really afford the membership fee. The Star Envoy Club maintains small (and very private) hotels and lounges at all class A and class starports that are accessible only to members and their quests. Deals with all the major carriers mean that the Club can offer an elite-class travel ticket to every member once every two months. Tickets not used are lost. Membership of the Club is a privilege and says much about the character's wealth and social standing. Transdyne Cybersystems (TDC) A dedicated robotic manufacturing corporation, TDC builds all kinds of cybersystems, for every possible task. The software division is exemplary and also jealous. It has been known for TDC to release icebreaker software on shareware bulletins in the hope that some desperate cowboy hacker will use it; these programs are often booby-trapped and allow the target corp to trace the perpetrator straight away. TDC has also made radical developments in Artificial Intelligence and uses AI technology in many robotic and software applications. Fully aware androids are now on the production line and very popular with high-end security firms, space agencies, SWAT teams, seabed exploration companies and rescue services. The lifelike qualities of this fourth generation of human robots are staggering, and many people can be easily fooled by the Transdyne products. Just as with the earlier generations of human robots, modern androids are extremely complex, sophisticated and expensive. The tasks they are given are typically extraordinarily difficult, dangerous or exacting. The biggest cyborg sellers are the multi-tasking technician model the Transdyne Cybersystems 70 (selling for around $800,000, equivalent to the cost of a military armoured vehicle) and the combat model Transdyne Cybersystems 110 (selling for around $2 million, roughly equivalent to the cost of an armoured tank). Yoshiko A large retail corporation that owns famous the Robot Cafe restaurant chain, many department stores worldwide and clothing, food and household production factories. Yoshiko is a vast, faceless corporation with a very secretive board of directors. No one is sure who make up the board and theories run wild. Yoshiko is pervasive and can seem very frightening. Breakfast cereal bars, toothpaste, shoes, bottles, vending machines... Yoshiko is the consumer glue that keeps the 23rd century together and that provides the products that keep society ticking over. The corporation's symbol of the Japanese rising sun is seen virtually everywhere.","title":"Key Corporations"},{"location":"Current_Events/Key_Corporations/#key-corporations","text":"The following corporations are powerful and dynamic, having a bold and aggressive place in the interstellar economy.

My rifle and I are the defenders of my country. We are the masters of our enemy. We are the saviours of my life. So be it, until victory is America's and there is no enemy but peace. From The Creed of the United States Marine The United States Marine Corps (USMC) is America's premier quick reaction force, capable of being deployed at short notice via land, sea, air and space. The USMC put troops on board the first US Space Command (USSC) space stations in the 2020s, Marines travelled to Mars in 2027 and helped build Camp Deerman at Reunion in 2028. For deployments into space, the Marine Corps works closely with the United States Space Command (see below). It is now standard for Marines to receive training in space operations and part of that training is the High-Intensity Survival Training (HIST), usually carried out on the Moon or on Mars. Following basic training, a Marine is usually assigned to one of three active Marine ground divisions: the 1st Marine Division (Camp Pendleton, CA.), 2nd Marine Division (Camp Lejeune, NC.) and the 3rd Marine Division (Twentynine Palms Base, CA). Marines in combat are supported by air and spacecraft, and these elements are organized as three Marine aerospace wings: 1st Marine Aerospace Wing, 2nd Marine Aerospace Wing and the 35th Marine Aerospace Wing. The Corps also maintains three logistical units that supply vehicles, catering, supplies and maintenance. Unsurprisingly, they are named the 1st Marine Logistics Group, the 2nd Marine Logistics Group and the 3rd Logistics Group. This all seems straightforward, however, these divisions and wings and the units that they are divided up into, are rarely committed to battle wholesale. Instead, three permanent task forces are in existence that take Marine units from those divisions and aerospace wings on a long-term basis, and these Marine Expeditionary Forces (MEFs) stand ready to fight major armed conflicts for the USA and its Community of American State allies. II Marine Expeditionary Force, for example, is currently composed of the 2nd Marine Division, the 2nd Marine Aerospace, Wing and the 2nd Marine Logistics Group. II MEF also includes a command group and three smaller composite units called Marine Expeditionary Units (MEU's); the 22nd MEU, the 24th MEU and the 26th MEU. The Marine Expeditionary Unit When not engaged in major wars (such as on Tau Ceti at the moment), the bulk of Marine work is conducted by these smaller, easily transportable Marine Expeditionary Units. Each one is composed of a reinforced Battalion Landing Team, a reinforced aerospace squadron, a combat logistics battalion and company-sized headquarters element. All of the units are pulled from the parent Marine Expeditionary Force and in total, the MEU'S manpower stands at around 2,200. It is usually commanded by a Marine colonel. Units that make up an active MEU spend a year deployed onboard US Space Command starships, this is followed by three months leave on Earth, followed by six months of training. While the MEU has its downtime, another MEU is deployed in its place. An MEU has everything it needs to fight without short-term resupply or reinforcement: infantry, armoured vehicles, artillery, recon assets, headquarters and communications, supply, engineering, maintenance, medical support, catering and aerospace support and drop capability. It is an 'army-on-the-move', deployed not at a Marine base, but at a US Space Command base where it can rapidly board assault ships to meet a new threat. Roughly 200 troops are involved with logistics, 600 involved with aerospace and aviation and 300 forms a recon and security unit leaving around 1,100 personnel fighting as infantrymen and crewing armoured vehicles and artillery pieces. The Marine Corps is the United States' premier intervention force, specializing in amphibious assault, hostage rescue, and heliborne assault. Although traditionally closely associated with the US Navy, the US Marine Corps has recently made history by being the first military force to deploy its troops away from Earth\u2014first to the International Space Station (ISS) and then to Mars. The 24th MEU The 24th MEU is comprised of elements from the 2nd Marine Division and is currently located in the Epsilon Eridani star system, at USSC Base Vigilance. From here it is ready to be deployed out to the Outer Rim when needed. The 24th MEU has operational headquarters at Twentynine Palms Base, in California, which is close to Edwards Space Force Base. The 24th MEU is comprised of around 2,000 Marines, supported by an artillery battery, recon and engineering elements, armoured personnel carriers and orbit-capable military spaceplanes called 'drop-ships'. The unit is transported to any required destination (given time) by US Space Command vertical assault carriers (either the Grissom or the Shepard class). These are primarily designed to hold, transport and deploy a space-capable MEU and they are on permanent standby to ferry parts of the MEU to anywhere required by order of the US president. The 24th MEU is commanded by Colonel Oscar Ramirez. His immediate subordinate officers are three Lieutenant Colonels, one commands the MEU's Ground Combat Element (a reinforced battalion of three rifle companies), another commands the MEU's Air Combat Element \u2022 the Marine Medium Dropship Squadron 764 (DMM-764), known as \"Texas Thunder.\" The third Lt. Colonel commands the MEU's Combat Support Element (eight platoons, each covering a different speciality, from communications to maintenance, engineering to medical). Infantry Above all, the Marine Corps is an iS infantry force, all other assets are designed to deliver and support the Marine infantryman in battle. All Marines receive regular combat training, they are tough and have long gone by the nickname of 'leathernecks'. The Marine infantry force of the 24th MEU is provided by the 1st Battalion of the 8th Marine Regiment (part of the 2nd Division) (shortened to '1/8 Marines'). The battalion has three rifle companies, a weapons (ie. support) company and an HQ company. Companies are lettered phonetically (Bravo Company, Alpha Company, etc.). The rifle company, each commanded by a captain, is the basic fighting unit of the Marine Corps. It is comprised of three rifle platoons (of three squads each) along with a command group and a weapons (support) platoon. Platoons are led by lieutenants. It is the 13-man squads that do the dirty work, each is led by a sergeant and often divided into three teams (each commanded by a corporal). All riflemen are equipped with an M24A1 8.85mm advanced combat rifle (firing caseless ammunition), the Hewison M5 Integrated Combat Suit and an M9 Eagle-Eye short-range disposable missile. The primary transport of the Marines is the Advanced Motors ARCC-50 (Armored Combat Carrier) The 140 men of the three rifle companies are carried into battle and out on long\u2022 range patrol by ten ARCCs. Each ARCC is a well-armoured hostile environment rover with complete life support systems for one month, advanced imaging systems and electronic to defences, with a cabin able to carry a 13-man squad. The crew of the ARCC is two: driver and gunner/commander. For self-defence, the standard personnel carrier version of the ARCC carries a cupola-mounted GAU-122 25mm Gatling gun as well as a dorsal turret mounting two Zenith 52 MW free-electron pulse lasers. Other specialist Marine platoons have their own ARCC variants. Artillery Battery The MEU includes a battery of six hostile-environment M180 self-propelled railguns. Additional firepower, light reconnaissance, and battlefield protection is provided by turreted Zenith M3 40MW phased plasma guns mounted on two Growler Utility Combat Vehicles. Heavy Weapons The weapons company provides fire support and an anti-armour capability with an MQ-6 Phantom combat drone platoon, a heavy weapons platoon with a Zenith M3 40MW phased plasma guns and M65 Gecko Multi-Purpose Missile Launchers (both mounted on eight Growler Utility Combat Vehicles) and an anti-armour platoon equipped with eight Growlers carrying an M-30 Avenger anti-armour missile launchers. Combat Engineers This platoon supports the breaching of obstacles, building of causeways, bunkers and fortifications as well other structures, it also provides engineering and construction services. It is equipped with a bulldozer and a variety of other equipment. Armored Recon Platoon Combined with Growlers from the heavy weapons company, this is a mixed platoon used for armed reconnaissance. The platoon typically includes three Growlers (armed with Zenith M3 40MW plasma guns), two Growlers mounted with M-30 Avenger anti-armor missile launchers, and three Matsuyama MQ-6 Phantoms (each with their associated control Growler and transport truck). Dropships Civilian airlines routinely operate trans atmospheric vehicles or space-planes on Earth that take-off at international airports as jets, then at high-altitudes switch to ramat rockets to propel them into orbit. The Marine Corps have been able to commission a VTOL-capable version for vertical envelopment from orbit, and orbital re-supply. These 'dropships' carry out many of the duties of the helicopter on a terrestrial battlefield. The 24th MEU has sixteen UD-5 Mustang dropships manufactured by Global Dynamics which are all part of the Marine Medium Dropship Squadron 764 (DMM-764), \"Texas Thunder\". It also boasts fourteen ground-attack variants of the Mustang and two further Mustangs fitted out for the squadron command and control task. Providing heavy lift capabilities are four CS-9 Thunderchief shuttles, also from \"Texas Thunder\". Each Mustang must fulfil variety of battlefield roles, most important of which is troop transport dropping an ARCC and its passengers directly onto a planetary surface. Additional duties include general transport, recon, tactical air support for the ground forces (especially the ARCC and its squad), forward observation, medevac and search and rescue. As an air support platform the dumpy but powerful Mustang boasts a forward firing 25mm Gatling Gun and two rocket pods each carrying twelve 70mm unguided rockets. Snipers The headquarters company of the MEU includes the Surveillance and Target Acquisition (STA) Platoon. These guys are snipers, trackers, artillery fire directors and even forward air controllers. The STA may be inserted by dropship into enemy territory, and the platoons have pioneered the dangerous technique of the ACOR jump. This is an Ablative Canopy Orbital Re-entry, where individual Marines climb inside ablative re-entry balls just in 2m in diameter and fall through the atmosphere, surviving the heat of re-entry to land safely on a parawing at a pre-determined Landing Zone. There were many fatalities while perfecting the ACOR jump. The snipers work in teams of two, both armed with M1000 30MW Laser Rifles. Recon Marines Recon Marines are an elite, toughened and highly trained Marines carrying out dangerous reconnaissance work ahead of any assault. These troops gather intelligence and therefore try to avoid contact with the enemy. They are masters of stealth. Like the snipers of the STA, the Recon Marines have been practicing ACOR jumps with some success. A more common (and safer) method of insertion is via is drop-ship or HALO jump (high-altitude low-opening). A number of non-standard weapons are carried by Recon Marines to fit the missions they are given. Additional missions include antiterrorist work and hostage rescue as well as artillery forward observation and path finding. One platoon of Recon Marines is always attached to the 24th MEU. This platoon has four teams of four men and is commanded by a lieutenant.

All of the units are pulled from the parent Marine Expeditionary Force and in total, the MEU'S manpower stands at around 2,200. It is usually commanded by a Marine colonel. Units that make up an active MEU spend a year deployed onboard US Space Command starships, this is followed by three months leave on Earth, followed by six months of training. While the MEU has its downtime, another MEU is deployed in its place. An MEU has everything it needs to fight without short-term resupply or reinforcement: infantry, armoured vehicles, artillery, recon assets, headquarters and communications, supply, engineering, maintenance, medical support, catering and aerospace support and drop capability. It is an 'army-on-the-move', deployed not at a Marine base, but at a US Space Command base where it can rapidly board assault ships to meet a new threat. Roughly 200 troops are involved with logistics, 600 involved with aerospace and aviation and 300 forms a recon and security unit leaving around 1,100 personnel fighting as infantrymen and crewing armoured vehicles and artillery pieces. The Marine Corps is the United States' premier intervention force, specializing in amphibious assault, hostage rescue, and heliborne assault. Although traditionally closely associated with the US Navy, the US Marine Corps has recently made history by being the first military force to deploy its troops away from Earth\u2014first to the International Space Station (ISS) and then to Mars.","title":"The Marine Expeditionary Unit"},{"location":"Current_Events/United_States_Marine_Corps/#the-24th-meu","text":"The 24th MEU is comprised of elements from the 2nd Marine Division and is currently located in the Epsilon Eridani star system, at USSC Base Vigilance. From here it is ready to be deployed out to the Outer Rim when needed. The 24th MEU has operational headquarters at Twentynine Palms Base, in California, which is close to Edwards Space Force Base. The 24th MEU is comprised of around 2,000 Marines, supported by an artillery battery, recon and engineering elements, armoured personnel carriers and orbit-capable military spaceplanes called 'drop-ships'. The unit is transported to any required destination (given time) by US Space Command vertical assault carriers (either the Grissom or the Shepard class). These are primarily designed to hold, transport and deploy a space-capable MEU and they are on permanent standby to ferry parts of the MEU to anywhere required by order of the US president. The 24th MEU is commanded by Colonel Oscar Ramirez. His immediate subordinate officers are three Lieutenant Colonels, one commands the MEU's Ground Combat Element (a reinforced battalion of three rifle companies), another commands the MEU's Air Combat Element \u2022 the Marine Medium Dropship Squadron 764 (DMM-764), known as \"Texas Thunder.\" The third Lt. Colonel commands the MEU's Combat Support Element (eight platoons, each covering a different speciality, from communications to maintenance, engineering to medical).","title":"The 24th MEU"},{"location":"Current_Events/United_States_Marine_Corps/#infantry","text":"Above all, the Marine Corps is an iS infantry force, all other assets are designed to deliver and support the Marine infantryman in battle. All Marines receive regular combat training, they are tough and have long gone by the nickname of 'leathernecks'. The Marine infantry force of the 24th MEU is provided by the 1st Battalion of the 8th Marine Regiment (part of the 2nd Division) (shortened to '1/8 Marines'). The battalion has three rifle companies, a weapons (ie. support) company and an HQ company. Companies are lettered phonetically (Bravo Company, Alpha Company, etc.). The rifle company, each commanded by a captain, is the basic fighting unit of the Marine Corps. It is comprised of three rifle platoons (of three squads each) along with a command group and a weapons (support) platoon. Platoons are led by lieutenants. It is the 13-man squads that do the dirty work, each is led by a sergeant and often divided into three teams (each commanded by a corporal). All riflemen are equipped with an M24A1 8.85mm advanced combat rifle (firing caseless ammunition), the Hewison M5 Integrated Combat Suit and an M9 Eagle-Eye short-range disposable missile. The primary transport of the Marines is the Advanced Motors ARCC-50 (Armored Combat Carrier) The 140 men of the three rifle companies are carried into battle and out on long\u2022 range patrol by ten ARCCs. Each ARCC is a well-armoured hostile environment rover with complete life support systems for one month, advanced imaging systems and electronic to defences, with a cabin able to carry a 13-man squad. The crew of the ARCC is two: driver and gunner/commander. For self-defence, the standard personnel carrier version of the ARCC carries a cupola-mounted GAU-122 25mm Gatling gun as well as a dorsal turret mounting two Zenith 52 MW free-electron pulse lasers. Other specialist Marine platoons have their own ARCC variants.","title":"Infantry"},{"location":"Current_Events/United_States_Marine_Corps/#artillery-battery","text":"The MEU includes a battery of six hostile-environment M180 self-propelled railguns. Additional firepower, light reconnaissance, and battlefield protection is provided by turreted Zenith M3 40MW phased plasma guns mounted on two Growler Utility Combat Vehicles.","title":"Artillery Battery"},{"location":"Current_Events/United_States_Marine_Corps/#heavy-weapons","text":"The weapons company provides fire support and an anti-armour capability with an MQ-6 Phantom combat drone platoon, a heavy weapons platoon with a Zenith M3 40MW phased plasma guns and M65 Gecko Multi-Purpose Missile Launchers (both mounted on eight Growler Utility Combat Vehicles) and an anti-armour platoon equipped with eight Growlers carrying an M-30 Avenger anti-armour missile launchers. Combat Engineers This platoon supports the breaching of obstacles, building of causeways, bunkers and fortifications as well other structures, it also provides engineering and construction services. It is equipped with a bulldozer and a variety of other equipment. Armored Recon Platoon Combined with Growlers from the heavy weapons company, this is a mixed platoon used for armed reconnaissance. The platoon typically includes three Growlers (armed with Zenith M3 40MW plasma guns), two Growlers mounted with M-30 Avenger anti-armor missile launchers, and three Matsuyama MQ-6 Phantoms (each with their associated control Growler and transport truck). Dropships Civilian airlines routinely operate trans atmospheric vehicles or space-planes on Earth that take-off at international airports as jets, then at high-altitudes switch to ramat rockets to propel them into orbit. The Marine Corps have been able to commission a VTOL-capable version for vertical envelopment from orbit, and orbital re-supply. These 'dropships' carry out many of the duties of the helicopter on a terrestrial battlefield. The 24th MEU has sixteen UD-5 Mustang dropships manufactured by Global Dynamics which are all part of the Marine Medium Dropship Squadron 764 (DMM-764), \"Texas Thunder\". It also boasts fourteen ground-attack variants of the Mustang and two further Mustangs fitted out for the squadron command and control task. Providing heavy lift capabilities are four CS-9 Thunderchief shuttles, also from \"Texas Thunder\". Each Mustang must fulfil variety of battlefield roles, most important of which is troop transport dropping an ARCC and its passengers directly onto a planetary surface. Additional duties include general transport, recon, tactical air support for the ground forces (especially the ARCC and its squad), forward observation, medevac and search and rescue. As an air support platform the dumpy but powerful Mustang boasts a forward firing 25mm Gatling Gun and two rocket pods each carrying twelve 70mm unguided rockets. Snipers The headquarters company of the MEU includes the Surveillance and Target Acquisition (STA) Platoon. These guys are snipers, trackers, artillery fire directors and even forward air controllers. The STA may be inserted by dropship into enemy territory, and the platoons have pioneered the dangerous technique of the ACOR jump. This is an Ablative Canopy Orbital Re-entry, where individual Marines climb inside ablative re-entry balls just in 2m in diameter and fall through the atmosphere, surviving the heat of re-entry to land safely on a parawing at a pre-determined Landing Zone. There were many fatalities while perfecting the ACOR jump. The snipers work in teams of two, both armed with M1000 30MW Laser Rifles. Recon Marines Recon Marines are an elite, toughened and highly trained Marines carrying out dangerous reconnaissance work ahead of any assault. These troops gather intelligence and therefore try to avoid contact with the enemy. They are masters of stealth. Like the snipers of the STA, the Recon Marines have been practicing ACOR jumps with some success. A more common (and safer) method of insertion is via is drop-ship or HALO jump (high-altitude low-opening). A number of non-standard weapons are carried by Recon Marines to fit the missions they are given. Additional missions include antiterrorist work and hostage rescue as well as artillery forward observation and path finding. One platoon of Recon Marines is always attached to the 24th MEU. This platoon has four teams of four men and is commanded by a lieutenant. Intelligence Teams The ME headquarters element includes an S-2 officer (Captain Robert Hauk) heading an intelligence section covering interrogation, image interpretation, counter-intelligence support, cartography and electronic surveillance/ interpretation.","title":"Heavy Weapons"},{"location":"Equipment/","text":"Equipment The following sections list examples of standard equipment that adventurers may want to purchase.

Built around a sturdy carbon fibre skeleton is a complex system of silicon muscles that stabilises and controls. An outer covering of bio-plastic sheeting is built upon a layer of flexible collagenous fibres. The most modern androids operate with a Model/4 computer running either a level 1, 2 or 3 Intellect program. Power is provided for around three months by a 25 kW fuel cell requiring liquid hydrogen fuel. Androids do not need to breathe, drink or eat. Still, they occasionally ingest a pale-coloured, semi-organic nutrient suspension in a silicon-based liquid medium that serves as a lubricant for the system's micro hydraulics. It is prudent for androids to wear vacc suits or hostile environment suits since machinery, processor, fuel cell, and outer skin are susceptible to damage. Vacuum, high pressure, high temperature and aggressive atmospheric chemical constituents can irreparably damage an android. The cost of a single unit precludes the avoidable and wasteful use of an android in such an environment. Most androids are competent and of average human intelligence. They are generally programmed with passive, non-aggressive personalities and given the likeness of mature (30-40-year-old) male or female. The aim is to blend in, join in, be a team player within a group of humans, support the leadership and provide valuable options and advice without being forceful. All androids are ordered from Transdyne Cybersystems directly. All are custom-made and ready for delivery within 6 to 10 months. Buyers must specify their preferred options. To build an android, begin with a chassis, add software, and any preferred options. Repair Station Androids require an upright repair station, massing around 200 kg into which the android itself steps. A transparent lid then closes, and the android plugs in and undergoes a diagnostic and lubricant change. The fuel cell is topped up with liquid hydrogen if needed. Typically, androids will require a check-up every month or after sustaining damage. Building an Android To build an android, begin with a chassis, add software, and then any optional modifications.

Various brands offer utilities, including Novomo, Bauspace, KNiTK, and YoYo. Cost $160, Mass: negligible. Boots : A standard Marine Corps issue pair of SSG Commando Tactical Boots. They are used for civilian hiking and expedition work. Cold Weather Clothing : Protects against bitterly cold weather (-20o C or below).

Enforcer M21 Rigid Plated Armor : Enforcer Armaments Corporation produces ERPA or rigid plated armour made of a composite alloy shell - mainly titanium aluminide alloy over a layer of boron carbide resin fixed to a core of carbon fibre. A Kevlar/Salar woven liner rounds off the protection. It comes in the form of a helmet; a full-torso, clamshell-style, rigid body shell; and a set of lower leg guards. The Enforcer M34 Helmet features a microphone, tactical camera, slide-down protective visor and an integral Zenith PRC-45 short-range radio. This is exclusively military or paramilitary. Cost $3250. Mass 4 kg. Hewison M5 Integrated Combat Suit : In environments where the warfighter requires complete environmental protection, Hewison Industries offers the M5 Integrated Combat Suit. This full-body suit protects against vacuum, high or low temperature, biological or chemical agents in unbreathable atmospheres and against radiation typically found in a hard vacuum (decreasing exposure by up to 40 rads/hr). It can support a soldier for six hours, much like a standard spacesuit, but the M5 is made of Kevlar and Salar woven layers sandwiching ceramic plates. Titanium-carbide plates reinforce vulnerable areas, and these rigid sections are backed by carbon fibre. The suit is coated with radar-absorbent neoprene polymer impregnated with conductive carbon black particles to reduce radar signature. The suit includes a Zenith PRC-45 radio, multi-beam flashlight, tethers and equipment pockets, TapTintTM anti-flash visor technology and thermal masking. This last feature provides the infantryman with a modicum of stealth against infra-red sensor devices: heat is sunk into a chill can, which must be replaced after one hour of use. The M5 is exclusively frontline military. Cost $20,000. Mass 18 kg. KNiTK Poncho : A useful hooded waterproof coverall, with a reversible sun- reflective inner). Cost $30. Mass 0.5kg. McConnell 456 Soft Suit : The soft vacc suit can be used in a vacuum, but the air pressure must be reduced to prevent ballooning. This requires wearers to have spent some hours before the EVA pre- breathing oxygen. Because of this, hard suits are instead routinely used for work in a vacuum or near-vacuum. Soft suits, meanwhile, are used on planetary surfaces for protection against low pressures, radiation (decreasing exposure by up to 20 rads/hr), cold temperatures and unbreathable atmospheres. The suit has a duration of six hours. Cost $6,000. Mass 12 kg. McConnell 720 Mining Suit : Designed for hard, physical labour and includes advanced temperature control, climbing harness, flashlights and rad counter. Used by miners or others working in hazardous conditions, the suit is a soft suit with a rigid torso and significant armoured protection (AR 6). The mining suit can be used in a vacuum, just like soft suits, but the air pressure must be reduced to prevent ballooning. This requires wearers to have spent some hours before the EVA pre-breathing oxygen. Because of this, hard suits are instead routinely used for work in a vacuum or near-vacuum. The suit has a duration of eight hours. Cost $9,650. Mass 9 kg. Stern B Ballistic Vest : This tactical vest protects the torso and is worn over clothing. Made of woven Salar and Kevlar ballistic cloths, the vest is suitable for protection against low-calibre rounds and high-velocity fragmentation with hardened lightweight K-type ceramic inserts. In a variety of colours or camo patterns. Includes lots of pockets for carrying ammo and equipment. Cost $450. Mass 2 kg. Stern C Concealable Vest : A lightweight, soft ballistic vest for impact-resistant Salar and Kevlar fibres for the torso. The fabric absorbs impact energy and spreads it over the torso, resulting in bruising. It can be effectively concealed under regular clothing, although observers making an Int check at 8+ will notice something unusual. Cost $500. Mass 1 kg. Tharsis A38 Hard Suit : The hard vacc suit is the spacer's best friend, providing life support and protection when in space. For six hours, the suit provides a breathable atmosphere and protection from the extremes of temperature, low pressure, and radiation typically found in a hard vacuum (decreasing exposure by up to 40 rads/hr). Hard suits are rigid and have segmented joints for freedom of movement; they can operate at high pressures, which means wearers do not need to pre-breathe oxygen before use. Cost $9,000. Mass 9 kg. Tharsis H200 Hostile Environment Suit : Hostile environment suits are designed for conditions where a normal vacc suit would be insufficient, such as deep underwater, worlds shrouded in toxic or corrosive gases, extremes of radiation or temperature, or other locales that offer serious physical danger as well as the lack of a breathable atmosphere. HEV suits provide all the life support of a normal vacc suit (for six hours). Still, they are also impervious to flames, intense radiation found at nuclear blast sites (decreasing radiation exposure by 90 rads/hr), and high-pressure environments like undersea trenches. Cost $18,000. Mass 40 kg. Tharsis H-10 Survival Suit : Designed to protect the wearer from extreme cold or heat (-50oC to +50oC), the environment suit has a hood, gloves and boots but leaves the face exposed in everyday operations. It uses a power cell to provide internal heating or cooling. Although the survival suit offers a good seal against moisture or heat loss, the survival suit is not airtight or pressurised. Power cells will last for 20 days. Cost $500. Mass 2 kg. Armour Rating 2. Yoshiko GP Surface Mask : A standard Off-World survival mask that can filter contaminants, taints smoke and dust (atmosphere types 4, 7, and 9) and compress breathed air to allow survival in a low-pressure atmosphere (types 2 and 3).

High orbits allow longer transmission times but more extended periods when the ship is on the other side of the planet, below the horizon.","title":"Descriptions"},{"location":"Equipment/Computer_Hardware/","text":"Computer Hardware Desktop Workstations Model Brand Cost Mass Model/0 Aztec 001 Terminal 250 10 Model/1 CRM Basic 250 10 Model/2 IBN Professional Series 9 500 10 Model/3 Hosaka Farstar 200 1000 10 Model/4 IBN Professional Series 12 1500 10 Portable Terminals Model Brand Cost Mass Model/1 CMD ZX-22 300 5 Model/2 IBN Net space 2 700 5 Model/3 Hosaka Goldstar 2000 5 Model/4 Aztec-Sendai Cyberspace 64 5000 5 Model/5 Shinobi Farscape 5 8000 5 Model/6 Aztec-Sendai Cyberspace-6 10,000 5 Other Items Model Brand Cost Mass Data Card 5 - Optical Disc 15 - Optical Disc Player 250 2 E-Board 250 2 Descriptions Data Cards : The primary method of mobile information storage resembles modern-day smart cards. The inside of a data card contains an embedded microprocessor. Data cards include RAM and a 16-bit microprocessor; they use a serial interface and receive their power from the card reader. Mass negligible cost $5. ROM Cards, however, are used to hold software and are slotted into ROM ports on a computer. Software is not installed onboard a portable terminal or workstation. ROM cards, like 1980\u2019s game cartridges, are slotted into the unit to interface with the onboard processor. A computer can hold and run as many ROM Cards as equal to its rating. A single ROM Card contains one program, and the cost is given overleaf. Mainframes : Corporations use mainframes, as do starships. These powerful computers are supported by a wired network that can be accessed via one or more workstations. Each workstation resembles a modern personal computer (PC), with a keyboard and monitor. Mainframes weigh around 100 kg and are usually fitted into a small purpose-built computer room with one or more workstations (see below). Optical Discs : Used as a more powerful file storage platform and the central format for playing media (video and audio). The standard Baumann GmbH MiniDisk series holds up to 15.9 gigabytes of data, and each glass disc is permanently mounted within a small, rectangular plastic case. The disc can withstand extreme temperatures and pressures and is predicted to hold its data internally for millennia. Their mass is negligible, and their cost is $15 each. Optical Disc Player A portable unit with a flip-up colour screen that can play MiniDisks. It incorporates built-in speakers and a storage area within the case for up to twenty Baumann MiniDisks. Although most Portable Terminals have MiniDisk readers, they can only read data from the discs and cannot play video or audio. The character will require a dedicated Disc Player with its colour screen capabilities. Mass is 2 kg, and the cost is $250. Portable terminals : Stand-alone computers resemble modern laptops with hinged cases and often run dedicated software; however, they must be connected to the hardware they control via a cable. Controls for complex field equipment require these dedicated laptops, usually supplied in tough, anti-shock cases with integral carry handles. Portable terminals are also known as cyberdecks because of their typical use to access cyberspace. Portable terminals weigh 5 kg and are rated from Model/1 to Model/6. Workstations : Model/0 are 'dumb stations' used to access a mainframe and cannot run its programs. Workstations, however, can also be stand-alone computers, much like modern-day PCs. They have integral processors and hard drives with dedicated software. Workstations in some installations or businesses will often be connected via a wired network and can be rated as a Model/1 to a Model/4. A workstation weighs around 10kg (without a chair and console unit) and costs $250. E-Board : Clipboard-sized, hand-held Model/0 terminal running administration and record-keeping software. It has a monochromatic screen with an in-built stylus. The memex is rugged, and it features a data card slot and a spring-loaded jack cable for plugging into any videofone unit that enables it to access the Network. This electronic clipboard (\u2018e-board\u2019) weighs 2 kg and costs $250.","title":"Computer Hardware"},{"location":"Equipment/Computer_Hardware/#computer-hardware","text":"","title":"Computer Hardware"},{"location":"Equipment/Computer_Hardware/#desktop-workstations","text":"Model Brand Cost Mass Model/0 Aztec 001 Terminal 250 10 Model/1 CRM Basic 250 10 Model/2 IBN Professional Series 9 500 10 Model/3 Hosaka Farstar 200 1000 10 Model/4 IBN Professional Series 12 1500 10","title":"Desktop Workstations"},{"location":"Equipment/Computer_Hardware/#portable-terminals","text":"Model Brand Cost Mass Model/1 CMD ZX-22 300 5 Model/2 IBN Net space 2 700 5 Model/3 Hosaka Goldstar 2000 5 Model/4 Aztec-Sendai Cyberspace 64 5000 5 Model/5 Shinobi Farscape 5 8000 5 Model/6 Aztec-Sendai Cyberspace-6 10,000 5","title":"Portable Terminals"},{"location":"Equipment/Computer_Hardware/#other-items","text":"Model Brand Cost Mass Data Card 5 - Optical Disc 15 - Optical Disc Player 250 2 E-Board 250 2","title":"Other Items"},{"location":"Equipment/Computer_Hardware/#descriptions","text":"Data Cards : The primary method of mobile information storage resembles modern-day smart cards.

The effect lasts for half an hour, giving the PC +1 on any physical action or social task. The side effect is a bout of nausea, dizziness (-2 all actions) lasting for an hour that takes effect instead of the high. If an Easy (+4) Endurance roll is then failed, the character also blacks out and suffers 1D6 damage. $100. Aspedine : Prevents intoxication via alcohol, useful on missions where social drinking must take place. After such a night, most people will be at-3 on all actions. Aspedine ensures a character stays fully alert. Cost $300. Benzoditropolene : This is a universal antitoxin effective against most poisons and nerve agents. On a 2D6 roll of 10+, it may even work against a more obscure poison. Works within one minute, arresting the poison's effects. Recovery then begins as usual. Cost $600. Betaseratonin ('Smart Drug') : This gives the user +1 on his technical or mental skills for 1-3 hours. The side effect is 'neuron misfire': the character is in a trance. Once a side effect is triggered, the character must make an Average Endurance roll to avoid having the side effect occur daily at random times (this random side effect is avoidable only if a dose of the smart drug is taken at the start of that day, i.e. It is very addictive!). Cost $400. Delta-14 : Chemical warfare toxin causing 2D6 damage if an Average (0) Endurance roll iS made and causing death if failed. The time varies with the delivery method, but an aerosol delivery typically works within 1-3 combat rounds. $700. Dexamphetamine ('Speed' or 'Dex') : This amphetamine, a central nervous stimulant, provides a tremendous neuro-physical boost and comes as a small pink octagonal tablet. Gain +2 to carry out any act or task that does not require calm, careful concentration; this may include athletic moves, combat or kicking down a door. It lasts half an hour. No concentration is allowed. The side effect is 'high' that lasts only 5 minutes, followed by about of nervous exhaustion (all actions at a-2) for a couple of hours. Once a side effect is triggered, the character must make an Average Endurance roll to avoid having the side effect occur daily at random times (this random side effect is avoidable only if a dose of social drug iS taken at the start of that day). Cost $200 Korteline : High energy drug allowing an 8-hour sleep period to be missed without the usual-3 penalty. A potential side effect is a deep depression (-1 all actions and an inability tO put oneself at risk) for 1D3 hours following that time. Cost $400. Lysophosphatidic Acid (LPA) : Must be administered before or immediately after (within ten minutes) suffering radiation exposure. It absorbs up to 100 rads per dose. A character may only use LPA once per day taking any more causes permanent Endurance damage of 1 point 1 per dose. Cost $300. Medical Drugs Three quality or rarity grades, 1, 2 & 3, with prices of $200, $800 and $2,000 respectively. Each dose is carried within a vacuum-sealed phial packed into a foam-filled box that mounts six phials each. Aminoglycosides (antibiotic) Antimetabolites (anti-cancer) Cotrimoxozole (antibacterial) Corticosteroids (immunosuppressants) Cytotoxic Antibiotics (anti-cancer) Idoxuridine (antiviral) Sulphacetamide (antibacterial) Sympathomimetic (neurotransmitter stimulant) Synthetic Thyroxine (thyroid imbalances) Tetracyclines (antibiotic) Pheromone-X ('Social Drug') : This is a mood relaxant that gives +1 to all social skills for 1-3 hours, those skills that generally involve personal interaction. The side effect is dulled senses and tiredness (-3 on all hearing and vision rolls). Once a side effect is triggered, the character must make an Average Endurance roll to avoid having the side effect occur daily at random times (this random side effect is avoidable only if a dose of the social drug is taken at the start of that day, i.e. It is very addictive!). $50. Polydichloric Euthimal ('PDE') : This mix of cocaine and meperidine is a central nervous drug that boosts physical performance. It gives the character +2 on any hand-to-hand combat and physical actions and cancels out all penalties from wounds sustained and potential unconsciousness. A character using the drug in combat adds +8 to his initiative total at the start of combat (or whenever the drug takes effect). The user becomes cold-blooded with no chance of success in his social skills. The side effect of PDE is catatonic fear, during which the character cowers in fear or behaves suicidally. The drug (or its side effect) lasts for one hour. Once a side effect is triggered, the character must make an Average Endurance roll to avoid having the side effect occur daily at random times (this random side effect is avoidable only if PDE is taken at the start of that day, i.e. It is very addictive!). Cost $500. Polypheronol-Z : A hallucinogenic drug that drowns the patient in pretty colours, emotional warmth and psychedelic trips. Haruna Biolabs created it in Chiba City to enable psycho-surgeons to unravel a patient's deep-rooted problems. Corporate snatch squads have recently used the drug as a truth serum. A single dose will result in one hour of 'truth' (often garbled with an awful lot of crap) as the patient talks in his post-hypnotic, auto-suggestive state of mind. This is followed by 1-6 hours of unconsciousness. A dose of PPZ costs $800. Synthetic Endorphin Analog ('Endorphin', 'Dorph') : This pain inhibitor cancels any penalties suffered from wounds and shrugging of unconsciousness for up to 1 hour. It can be taken as a precaution. The 'dorph's' side effect is a one-hour nervous attack instead of the drug's effects. This gives the player character-1 on all physical actions. Once a side effect is triggered, the character must make an Average Endurance roll to avoid having the side effect occur daily at random times (this random side effect is avoidable only if a dose of endorphin is taken at the start of that day, i.e. It is very addictive!). Cost $300. Virax-B : A tranquilliser inducing paralysis. Victim rolls Average (0) Endurance or is paralysed in round for 2D6 minutes. A successful roll means instead slowness and clumsiness (-2 on actions) for 2D6 mins.

They are useful tools, but subject to varied limitations, anything that moves can show up on the reading if not properly tuned out, extremely slow-moving objects may not show up at all, and of course, any enemy listening in will probably detect the loud ultra-sound bursts being emitted from the J34. The referee makes an Average Comms roll on the player\u2019s behalf to operate a motion tracker. With success, he can give the player a pretty accurate indication of what the scanner is picking up; if unsuccessful, he should give the player false data.

A short metre-long tether connects the spacer\u2019s belt to the grab pad, and this electro-adhesive pad adheres strongly to any metal surface once activated. It resembles a simple plate with a rugged handgrip. Electro-adhesive boots (known as \u2018mag boots\u2019) can fit hard suits. Cost $100. Mass 0.5kg. Advanced Motors Unique Umbilical : Although many spacers carry out EVA\u2019s using thruster packs disconnected from the spacecraft, it is often safer to use a length of umbilical. Gone are the days of a loose air pipe trailing in space. Each umbilical is a flexible pipe made up of 10m ball and socket links encased in a soft outer covering. A ratchet on the spacer\u2019s belt enables him to apply immediate tension to the links, locking him in place at his worksite. Up to 10 umbilicals can be connected to create a single tether, 100m long. $1000. 5kg. Bintang MMU-6 Thruster Pack : Longer EVAs, or transfers between spacecraft, require a thruster pack. Most starships have one in their locker. The pack is a 30kg fuel and motor unit worn on the back, with control arms swinging around for use at the front of a user. A joystick on the right arm and a keypad on the left provide complete control. Once the desired orientation is achieved, the user can engage an automatic attitude-hold function that maintains the inertial position of the pack in flight. This frees both hands for work. The pack holds enough nitrogen gas fuel for approximately 6 hours of EVA, though this does not constitute continuous thrust. Delta-V is an impressive 25 metres per second. Cost is $2000, 30kg. Fisher AG7 Retractable Space-Pen : Unlike ordinary ballpoint pens, Fisher Space Pens have a pressurised refill that allows them to write upside down and at any angle and in extreme conditions, from -34\u00b0C up to 121\u00b0 C. Not only can it write in zero-G, but it can even write over grease and underwater. Haruna Priority First Aid Kit : A small medical kit carried on a pouch that fits onto a rucksack or belt. It contains basic items, bandages, a pressure dressing, antibiotics, painkillers, eye-wash, antihistamines and plasters. It contains enough supplies for two wound treatments. Cost $50. Mass 0.5kg Kinako BB6 Basic Bubble : A large (2m diameter) pressurised and transparent plastic bubble. Piezoelectric layers in the bubble wall translate the user's movements into electricity to recharge the bubble's batteries and power its distress beacon. A small oxygen tank inflates the bubble and provides two-person/hours of life support. There is no airlock. Rescue bubbles can sometimes be found on space vessels and watercraft as emergency lifeboats. Cost $600. Mass 2 kg. McConnell 456 Soft Suit : The soft vacc suit can be used in a vacuum, but the air pressure must be reduced to prevent ballooning. This requires wearers to have spent some hours before the EVA pre-breathing oxygen. Because of this, hard suits are instead routinely used for work in a vacuum or near a vacuum. Soft suits, meanwhile, are used on planetary surfaces for protection against low pressures, radiation (decreasing exposure by up to 20 rads/hr), cold temperatures and unbreathable atmospheres. The suit has a duration of six hours. Cost $6,000. Mass 12 kg. Nortinghouse RS-5662 Thruster : For short duration EVAs, the handheld thruster is an invaluable and powerful tool that provides the spacer with a delta-V of 2 metres per second. It uses high-pressure cold gas (typically oxygen) as thrust, and being hand-held, it is highly versatile. The thruster costs $300 and has a mass of 2kg. It can sustain 15 minutes of flight. Reiner-Gama Orbital Tool Kit : The zero-G tool kit is essential for any repairs or construction work under-taken in zero gravity. It must be carried to the worksite, though hard suits can have such kits fitted as an optional extra. Tools in this kit are tailored for zero-G work; drills have counter-rotating heads to prevent torque from spinning the user around as a reaction. There are powered screwdrivers, wrenches, angle-grinders and saws, all battery-powered and benefitting from torque compensation. The basic portable kit costs Cr250 and masses 2kg. Costs $1000 and weighs 12kg. Rockford Aerospace Advanced Thruster Unit (ATU) : A gas-fueled thruster pack allows the user to manoeuvre in zero-gravity. A Vacc Suit skill check is required to use a thruster pack accurately. Thruster packs can only be used in zero-G environments and are only practical for journeys between spacecraft at the Adjacent range. Cost $2,000. Mass 5 kg. Safestar Type 1 Bio-Box : Some things need protecting from vacuum or hostile atmosphere, biological samples, delicate materials and even small animals (perhaps even pet cats and dogs). The Bio-Box is similar in size to a pet carrier but is pressurised and comes with a 6-hour air supply. Cost $450. Mass 2 kg. Tharsis A38 Hard Suit: The hard vacc suit is the spacer's best friend, providing life support and protection when in space. The suit provides a breathable atmosphere and protection from the extremes of temperature, low pressure and radiation typically found in a hard vacuum (decreasing exposure by up to 40 rads/hr) for six hours. Hard suits are rigid and have segmented joints for freedom of movement. They can operate at high pressures, so wearers do not need to pre-breathe oxygen before use. Cost $9,000. Mass 9 kg. Tharsis H200 Hostile Environment Suit : Hostile environment suits are designed for conditions where a normal vacc suit would be insufficient, such as deep underwater, worlds shrouded in toxic or corrosive gases, extremes of radiation or temperature, or other locales that offer serious physical danger as well as the lack of a breathable atmosphere. HEV suits provide all the life support of a normal vacc suit (for six hours). Still, they are also impervious to flames, intense radiation found at nuclear blast sites (decreasing radiation exposure by 90 rads/hr), and high-pressure environments like undersea trenches. Cost $18,000. Mass 40 kg. Tharsis M2 Ablative Canopy Orbital Re-entry (ACOR) : A personal re-entry kit allows a vacc- suited individual to enter a planetary atmosphere, survive, and parachute to the ground. This is a dangerous undertaking, usually practised by US Marines. ACOR packs are large and cumbersome, but the user can activate the system out of the airlock, inflating a 5m diameter ballute, with the user behind. The guidance computer and thruster unit which lay along the user's chest is now swung up, extended and activated. The descent begins with the ablative foam within the ballute sloughing off with the intense heat and friction. At an altitude of 15,000 feet, the main chute will deploy. The total time from orbit to touchdown is around 30-40 minutes. ACOR: Surviving Re-entry ACOR users must make an Average (+0) Vacc Suit roll to make a successful re-entry. Apply the following DMs: +1 Computer skill +1 Navigation skill +1 Pilot skill +2 Marine career +2 World Size 1 +1 World size 2 -2 Atmosphere B -4 Atmosphere C Failure indicates being off course or landing in a dangerous situation.

Yoshiko GP Surface Mask : A typical Off-World survival mask that can filter contaminants, taints smoke and dust (atmosphere types 4, 7, and 9) but can also compress breathed air to allow survival in a low-pressure atmosphere (types 2 and 3).

You spend hours in it every week, and some people spend most of their working day inside a suit. Your suit is personal, customised to the way you work. Colloquially, they are known as vacc suits (from everyday use in outer space vacuum'). Still, these suits can operate almost anywhere, from dusty, rocky surfaces within poisonous toxic atmospheres to frozen moons with icy methane atmospheres and other hostile places. Vacc suits are complex. Each is a self-contained space vehicle in its own right, with a breathable atmosphere, pressure regulation, heating and cooling controls, drinking water, 10 km radio and TV camera communications, a 5m range flashlight, limited micrometeoroid and radiation protection and the ability to do all that in a low-pressure environment that threatens to turn your suit into a balloon. Hard-working spacers can order custom suits that fit their exacting needs. Action Penalties Suits are bulky and constraining. All suits begin with a basic penalty to all physical actions taken while in the suit. Added extras further increase general encumbrance and can further increase this action penalty. Training and experience count for a lot, though. Of course, the wearer's Vacc Suit skill will negate these penalty DMs if it is of a high enough level. What's in a Suit? Standard kits include: Radio (10 km range) Radio Headset Drinking-Water (1-2 litres) TV Camera Worklight (5m range) Loops and carabiners for equipment Suit repair kit (for one large breach) PLSS recharge connector Basic Models There are four basic models: Soft Suits Mining suits Hard Suits Hostile Environment Suits (HES). Customized suits can also be manufactured to the buyer's unique specifications. Soft Suit This suit can be used in a vacuum, but to prevent ballooning, the air pressure must be reduced and requires wearers to have spent some hours before the EVA pre-breathing oxygen. Because of this, hard suits are instead routinely used for work in a vacuum or near-vacuum. Soft suits are better suited for use on planetary surfaces for protection against low pressures, radiation, cold temperatures, and unbreathable atmospheres. Soft suits are also generally less cumbersome to wear and work in than hard suits. Cost $6,000. Weight 12 kg. Armour Rating 4, Action Penalty -1. Duration 6 hours. Mining Suit Used by miners or others working in hazardous conditions, this suit is a customised semihard suit with a rigid torso. It includes armoured protection against accidental impacts, tears, and punctures. It is well-designed for hard, physical labour and includes advanced temperature control, climbing harness, flashlights, and a radiation counter. The suit can be used in a vacuum, like soft suits, and the air pressure must be reduced to prevent ballooning. This requires wearers to have spent some hours before the EVA pre-breathing oxygen. Cost $9,650. Weight 9 kg. Armour Rating 6. Action Penalty -1. Duration 6 hours. Hard Suit The hard vacc suit is the spacer's best friend, providing life support and protection when in space. The suit provides a breathable atmosphere and protection from the extremes of temperature, low pressure, and radiation typically found in a hard vacuum for up to six hours. Hard suits are rigid and have segmented joints for freedom of movement. They can operate at high pressures, so wearers do not need to pre-breathe oxygen before an EVA. Cost $9,000. Weight 9 kg. Armour Rating 6. Action Penalty -2. Duration 6 hours. Hostile Environment Suit Hostile environment suits (HES) are designed for conditions where a typical vacc suit would be insufficient, such as deep underwater, corrosive atmospheres, or extreme radiation or temperature. HES suits provide all the life support offered by a typical vacc suit but are also impervious to flames, intense radiation, and high-pressure environments like undersea trenches. The HES sncludes a radiation and toxic gas analyser. Cost $18,000. Weight 40 kg. Armour Rating 8. Action Penalty -3. Duration 6 hours. Custom Suits Manufacturers offer custom suits that include featured upgrades and add-ons to provide tailored utility for the buyer. A customized suit will be more expensive than a basic model, but the buyer gets what they want. Building A Custom Vacc Suit To build a custom suit, select a base suit design, a Personal Life Support System (PLSS), and up to three custom modifications that make your suit unique. Total the mass and cost and note any penalty assigned to actions taken when wearing the suit. The suit comprises several components: a torso assembly, a helmet, limbs, and PLSS backpack. Base Design Select the basic suit design from the table below.

Custom features are Extended Life Support , Mag Boots , and a Zero-G Tool Belt . Total cost : $11,700. Mass : 15 kg. Action Penalty : -3. Duration : 14 hours. The buyer will accept a required pre-breath before EVA to increase the usability of the suit for complex tasks over long shifts. The increased durability and lessened mass of the semi-hard shell outweighed the cost efficiency of a soft shell. Hostile Environment Suits Most vacc suits can cope with vacuum and temperatures from 120\u00b0C down to-180\u00b0C. There are more hostile environments: the Jovian moons are bathed in radiation, Mercury's dayside surface is a boiling 427\u00b0C, and on Venus, a visitor suffers the heat of Mercury with the added peril of being crushed by 92 atmospheres! The Tharsis H200 (HES) is an armoured and powered exo-suit with heat-shielding and advanced radiation protection. The visor can screen out UV radiation and allow vision even on near-star worlds. Finally, the suit is resistant to flame and extremely toxic atmospheres. Unlike the other vacc suits, it includes a radiation and toxic gas analyser and a thruster pack for manoeuvring in zero-G or underwater. It is built to withstand tremendous pressure from either alien atmospheres or ocean depths. Since it can maintain an Earth-like internal atmosphere, there is never any need for decompression. Life Inside Your Suit It goes without saying that a vacc suit can be bulky and uncomfortable, but there are some comforts. A full-body garment iS worn beneath the suit includes a water-cooled layer. Still, warm water can instead be sent through the system as the suit detects a change in the outside temperature. Drinking water, typically a litre or two, is included, and a drinking tube is fixed close to the wearer's mouth. They can also mount a food stick into a nearby housing, giving the wearer a chance to eat something if in the suit for several hours. Urine iS processed in thigh pockets and sent to the PLSS for recycling as drinking water. And if you need to defecate, the suit holds it in place. Even the best units can't reprocess that stuff. Go before you put the suit on. Most suits include gauges on wrists and chest that allow the wearer to check battery life, pressure, temperature, air and the PLSS system. Some designs integrate these into a Heads Up Display that appears on the wearer's faceplate. Comms are all voice-activated, with a wrist-mounted manual control as a backup. Controls for the PLSS are also mounted on the same wrist controller. It is standard practice to switch on the helmet camera when working. It means you aren't alone, comrades inside the base or ship can give you guidance and advice, and everything you see is recorded for later analysis. A small light illuminates the wearer's immediate working area. The PLSS can be recharged (air, water and electricity) at dedicated connectors within most airlocks. Other places, such as mining facilities, may have large banks of connectors in an EVA prep hall for many users to top up their PLSS at once. Every acceleration couch in a spacecraft includes an umbilical allowing the wearer to take off the PLSS (it gets in the way when laying in the couch) and rely on air from the vehicle if needed. Donning Your Suit It is possible to climb inside a vacc suit whilst wearing regular clothes, but they'd better be tight-fitting. Without the water-cooled full-body garment, the urine connections won't work, and any movement becomes hot and sweaty. Increase the action penalty by -1 after 2 hours. Putting on a suit properly requires 5 minutes if help is available 10 minutes if it isn't. Taking the suit off takes minutes. It is possible to do either of these faster in an emergency! Use the tasks below to speed up the process (do not factor in the suit's action penalty). Putting on a vacc suit while under stress : Vacc Suit, 3 rounds, Difficult (-2) Taking off a vacc suit while under stress : Vacc Suit, 2 rounds, Difficult (-2) PRE-BREATHING! To work effectively in a vacuum within a soft suit, pressure must be reduced to stop ballooning. However, with less air comes less oxygen, and the wearer will need to switch the air to 100% oxygen or risk blacking out. The downside is that partial pressures usually result in decompression sickness ('the bends'). Nitrogen in the blood is no longer constrained by pressure and bubbles out into muscles and vital organs. To prevent this, the space-walker must pre-breathe pure oxygen for 3 hours to purge nitrogen from his bloodstream. An EVA is almost an inverse of an ocean dive. The diver comes up from high water pressure to the low pressure of the surface. The spacewalker leaves the high pressure of the spacecraft for the low pressure of space. The spacewalker risks the 'bends' as soon as the EVA begins, not after. Avoiding the Bends : Endurance, DM-1 per hour of spacewalk (roll every hour)* * Assumes being in a vacuum in a soft suit with no time to pre-breath oxygen (i.e. an emergency decompression or urgent rescue EVA). The Bends Symptoms of the bends (deep pain, confusion, fatigue) occur 1D6 hours after the start of the spacewalk. The spacer makes an End roll and, if successful suffers 2D6 damage. If unsuccessful , the bends are almost undoubtedly fatal (6D6 damage). Immediate medical care with an oxygen mask and medkit can reduce damage by 8 points. Treating the Bends : Medic, 1-6 hours, Average BREACH! Once a suit is breached (perhaps from colliding with a piece of sharp debris while the wearer is repairing a drive), it takes 1-3 turns (roll 1D3) for the suit itself to self-repair the tear. In the first turn, the wearer suffers 1 pt of damage. In the second turn, he suffers 2 pts of damage, and in the third and subsequent turns, he suffers 4 pts. The damage is instant and often fatal for larger breaches, depending on the environment. Lack of oxygen might cause suffocation, toxic gases cause injury, and extremely high or low breach temperatures cause damage. Repairing a major breach : Vacc Suit, 1D3+1 rounds, Difficult (-2), or Very Difficult (-4) if repairing one's own suit. All suits include a suit repair kit.","title":"Vacc Suits"},{"location":"Equipment/Vacc_Suit/#vacc-suits","text":"","title":"Vacc Suits"},{"location":"Equipment/Vacc_Suit/#introduction","text":"The spacesuit is more important to you than any mere piece of clothing.

There are more hostile environments: the Jovian moons are bathed in radiation, Mercury's dayside surface is a boiling 427\u00b0C, and on Venus, a visitor suffers the heat of Mercury with the added peril of being crushed by 92 atmospheres! The Tharsis H200 (HES) is an armoured and powered exo-suit with heat-shielding and advanced radiation protection. The visor can screen out UV radiation and allow vision even on near-star worlds. Finally, the suit is resistant to flame and extremely toxic atmospheres. Unlike the other vacc suits, it includes a radiation and toxic gas analyser and a thruster pack for manoeuvring in zero-G or underwater. It is built to withstand tremendous pressure from either alien atmospheres or ocean depths. Since it can maintain an Earth-like internal atmosphere, there is never any need for decompression.","title":"Hostile Environment Suits"},{"location":"Equipment/Vacc_Suit/#life-inside-your-suit","text":"It goes without saying that a vacc suit can be bulky and uncomfortable, but there are some comforts. A full-body garment iS worn beneath the suit includes a water-cooled layer. Still, warm water can instead be sent through the system as the suit detects a change in the outside temperature. Drinking water, typically a litre or two, is included, and a drinking tube is fixed close to the wearer's mouth. They can also mount a food stick into a nearby housing, giving the wearer a chance to eat something if in the suit for several hours. Urine iS processed in thigh pockets and sent to the PLSS for recycling as drinking water. And if you need to defecate, the suit holds it in place. Even the best units can't reprocess that stuff. Go before you put the suit on. Most suits include gauges on wrists and chest that allow the wearer to check battery life, pressure, temperature, air and the PLSS system. Some designs integrate these into a Heads Up Display that appears on the wearer's faceplate. Comms are all voice-activated, with a wrist-mounted manual control as a backup. Controls for the PLSS are also mounted on the same wrist controller. It is standard practice to switch on the helmet camera when working. It means you aren't alone, comrades inside the base or ship can give you guidance and advice, and everything you see is recorded for later analysis. A small light illuminates the wearer's immediate working area. The PLSS can be recharged (air, water and electricity) at dedicated connectors within most airlocks. Other places, such as mining facilities, may have large banks of connectors in an EVA prep hall for many users to top up their PLSS at once. Every acceleration couch in a spacecraft includes an umbilical allowing the wearer to take off the PLSS (it gets in the way when laying in the couch) and rely on air from the vehicle if needed.","title":"Life Inside Your Suit"},{"location":"Equipment/Vacc_Suit/#donning-your-suit","text":"It is possible to climb inside a vacc suit whilst wearing regular clothes, but they'd better be tight-fitting.

However, with less air comes less oxygen, and the wearer will need to switch the air to 100% oxygen or risk blacking out. The downside is that partial pressures usually result in decompression sickness ('the bends'). Nitrogen in the blood is no longer constrained by pressure and bubbles out into muscles and vital organs. To prevent this, the space-walker must pre-breathe pure oxygen for 3 hours to purge nitrogen from his bloodstream. An EVA is almost an inverse of an ocean dive. The diver comes up from high water pressure to the low pressure of the surface. The spacewalker leaves the high pressure of the spacecraft for the low pressure of space. The spacewalker risks the 'bends' as soon as the EVA begins, not after.

It can carry a single ton intermodal container to the pad, raise it to a cargo hatch with its scissor lift action (up to 6m off the tarmac) and, using powered rollers, slide the box into the ship's hold. It is driven from a small cab mounted on the vehicle's side. AMC Aspen Four-Door Car : A popular road car used on Earth and some of the Off-World colonies. It is powered by a 110 kW fuel cell and can carry four passengers with 100 kg luggage. AMC Dynamic 7100 Mobile Mining Laser : Used on Off-World Mining installations, the Dynamic 7100 utilises a 50 MW deuterium fluoride laser to vaporise unwanted rocky material and cut ore up into manageable chunks ready for transport by the loader to the processor. The laser is mounted in a remotely operated turret on a 3-ton caterpillar-tracked chassis. The Dynamic is powered by a 980kw closed-cycle fuel cell, has a crew of 2 (driver and laser operator) and is equipped with towing bars, winches and a dozer blade, giving: some general versatility. The cab is not pressurised, although the vehicle can operate in a vacuum if the crew are suited. AMC Roadmaster 20-ton Truck : A common sight on highways, turnpikes and motorways, the Roadmaster is a twin axle, six-wheeled truck, classed as 'mid-sized' that has high body clearance making it popular also with the US military (in a modified version). The Roadmaster is powered by a 235 kW fuel cell (which can also be switched over to serve as a powerplant for other purposes if needed) and can carry 8,000 kg of cargo on its flatbed. The cab has room for two passengers. There are hundreds of variations of the Roadmaster apart from the military version, including enclosed cargo box bodies, chemical tankers, crane booms and refrigerated cargo boxes (reefers'). Chevrolet MM5 Bucket-Loader : A powerful four-wheeled excavator, the MM5 includes a weatherproof cab. Its Aztec 280 kW fuel cell powerplant can also work in vacuum environments, providing the operator wears a vacc suit. It is entirely off-road capable, with large and rugged wheels and a front end bucket capable of scooping up to 5,000 kg of material in one go. They are used by mining corporations across the Outer Rim and construction firms back on Earth. General Exoframes GE9 : Workloader A powered exoskeleton operating on a Gulfstar K24 Fuel Cell that features two hydraulic vice manipulators on the end of each arm. Its legged, walking design serves as an excellent machine for varied loading tasks, loading in confined areas or over rough terrain. The Loader has a single operator, and it can lift to 4,000 kg. or a single 1-ton ICO container. Global Dynamics ARCC-50 Armoured Combat Carrier : Each ARCC is a well-armoured hostile environment rover with complete life support systems for one month, advanced imaging systems and electronic defences, with a cabin able to carry a 13-man squad.

For self-defence, the standard personnel carrier version of the ARCC carries a cupola-mounted GAU-122 25mm Gatling gun and a dorsal turret mounting two Zenith 28 MW free-electron pulse lasers. Other units in the US army and marines have their ARCC variants. The ARCC is powered by a 450 kW fuel cell (a requirement when operating in vacuum conditions) and can achieve 90 kph with an operational range of 400 km. Global Dynamics UD-5 Mustang Dropship : The Mustang is a military spaceplane capable of reaching orbit and re-entering the planet's atmosphere. Mustangs are often used to drop marines onto an alien world with their APC and then return them to orbit to rendezvous with their starship. Each Mustang must fulfil various battlefield roles, the most important of which is troop transport dropping an ARCC and its passengers directly onto a planetary surface. Additional duties include general transport, recon, tactical air support for the ground forces (especially the ARCC and its squad), forward observation, medevac, and search and rescue. As an air support platform, the dumpy but powerful Mustang boasts a forward-firing 25mm Gatling Gun and two rocket pods, each carrying twelve 70mm unguided rockets. The Mustang can operate in an atmosphere with its thrust vectored jet turbines, and it is equipped with a Nortinghouse FDT-1124 ram rocket for exoatmospheric manoeuvring. The dropship has tons of fuel, enough for three burns: one gets it into orbit, the other it uses to deorbit and begin its descent into Earth's atmosphere, the third is used for loitering and up to hours of atmospheric flight. Under 60,000 feet altitude, the UD-5 Mustang is limited to subsonic speeds. An aft-facing cargo ramp extends to the floor for loading. There are folding acceleration seats for seven troops on either side of the cargo bay. A 5-ton APC can be driven up inside the cargo bay with the seats unoccupied, and no cargo carried. The Mustang has a 20-ton hull, costs $4M and requires a pilot and crew chief. GoMo QuadTrack : A two-seat all-terrain quad bike, the Quad Track employs four independent tracked assemblies rather than four wheels, giving it impressive off-road performance. A driver sits up front with the handlebar controls while the passenger sits on a seat behind him. A 250kg equipment rack extends from the back of the fuel-cell-powered vehicle. The QuadTrack is popular with mining groups and Off-World exploration teams. Gulfstar Growler Utility Combat Vehicle (UCV) : The Growler is a four-wheel drive, utility combat vehicle, a light truck with dozens of military applications, from light transport to medevac, reconnaissance and fire support. It has space for a driver and three passengers, with a short flat-bed at the rear for small cargoes. Many variants remove the rear seating and introduce a flatbed deck for a heavy weapons mount or a large cargo deck. The Growler incorporates floor armour as well as armoured doors and windows. A ring mount in the roof allows the front passenger to stand and operate a belt-fed M5A5 12mm coilgun machine gun. It is powered by a 180 kW fuel cell and can achieve a top speed of 90 kph. Leyland-Okuda Javelin 4X : A private supersonic jet used on Earth by VIPs, governments and corporations to travel intercontinental distances.

With stub wings and rotating turbofan engine nacelles on the tips, the 'super-sprey' is capable of vertical take-off like a helicopter and then a transition to standard forward flight, with a respectable aircraft-like speed of 560 kph. It has a range of 950 km and carries three crew (two pilots and a loadmaster/ crew chief) and up to 24 combat-equipped troops. They are used by many airforces and militaries around the world. McConnell AV-105 Jump-Jet Gunship : This military version of the MX Vector is equipped with mil-spec avionics and countermeasures. Its standard weapons fit includes a chin-mounted turret with 25 mm cannon and side-mounted 70mm rocket pods usually coupled with M30 anti-armour missile launchers. The AV-105 can serve as a battlefield tank destroyer or as protection for a flight of Vectors dropping troops into a landing zone. Speed is 420 kph and range around 400 km. McConnell MX Vector Utility Jump-Jet : Replacing helicopters in many roles, the utility jump jet uses vectored turbofans for stability, control and forward thrust. The Vector can be configured to carry either 16 passengers or 5,000 kg of cargo and incorporates a single side-mounted sliding door and a rear cargo ramp. It is used for search and rescue, cargo or passenger transport, fire-fighting, observation and police duties. It requires a crew of two. Speed is 420 kph and range around 400 km. Matsuyama EH1800 : The EH1800 is an immense dump truck (or haul truck) used on Off-World mines to transport up to 20 tons (or 100,000 kg) of waste rock out of the mine or to ferry freshly mined ore to the processor. A bucket-loader loads it. The EH1800 is 10m in length, and the top of the cab stands 5.7m above the ground. A stairway on the side of the cab allows the driver to reach the door. These dump trucks are enormous, ponderous machines with an open-box bed hinged at the rear and equipped with hydraulic pistons to lift the front, allowing the material in the bed to be dumped on the ground behind the truck at the site of delivery. Powered by a 2000 kW fuel cell, the truck cab is unpressurised, requiring the drive to be suited whilst operating in hostile environments. Matsuyama Reachstacker RS1000 : A wide wheel-base cargo mover operating on a Nortinghouse Transmat 310kw Gas Turbine with a single powerful telescoping boom ending in clamps that allow it to pick up, manipulate and rotate standard 1-ton, 2-ton and 3-ton cargo containers.

Used by government authorities, large corporations, and the wealthy, these hovercars have added an extra transportation layer to cities. The Hermes hovercar requires a single pilot and has a capacity for three (cramped) passengers. The luggage capacity is 250 kg. The Hermes is capable of a maximum of 300 kph in level flight but is generally restricted to airspace limits of 150 kph. The vehicle has fuel for 4 hours of operation and can reach 5,000 feet. A ballistic parachute system can be deployed in case of engine failure. Tharsis Aerospace Nimbus T23 Spaceplane : Human travel into orbit no longer depends on rockets or rocket mounted shuttles; Instead, comfortable and economical spaceplanes now make the journey. The Nimbus T23 series of spaceplanes are streamlined passenger liners capable of taking off from a runway on Earth and returning as gliders. The manoeuvre drive is a SABRE synergistic air-breathing rocket engine that accelerates the airliner to hypersonic speeds. It can reach low Earth orbit but not move beyond it. The T23 spaceplane has 6 tons of fuel, enough for two burns: one gets into orbit, and the other uses to deorbit and begin its descent into Earth's atmosphere. The Nimbus has a 40-ton hull and costs $3M. It has a crew of 4 and carries 30 passengers. Tharsis Armadillo GT800 All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV) : The Tharsis Armadillo is used when conditions are extreme, an all-terrain vehicle capable of carrying a team of explorers across a harsh environment and within a toxic atmosphere. Armadillos are used on alien worlds as trucks, personnel transports and expeditionary 'camper vans'.

Global Dynamics UD-5 Mustang Dropship : The Mustang is a military spaceplane capable of reaching orbit and re-entering the planet's atmosphere. Mustangs are often used to drop marines onto an alien world with their APC and then return them to orbit to rendezvous with their starship. Each Mustang must fulfil various battlefield roles, the most important of which is troop transport dropping an ARCC and its passengers directly onto a planetary surface. Additional duties include general transport, recon, tactical air support for the ground forces (especially the ARCC and its squad), forward observation, medevac, and search and rescue. As an air support platform, the dumpy but powerful Mustang boasts a forward-firing 25mm Gatling Gun and two rocket pods, each carrying twelve 70mm unguided rockets. The Mustang can operate in an atmosphere with its thrust vectored jet turbines, and it is equipped with a Nortinghouse FDT-1124 ram rocket for exoatmospheric manoeuvring. The dropship has tons of fuel, enough for three burns: one gets it into orbit, the other it uses to deorbit and begin its descent into Earth's atmosphere, the third is used for loitering and up to hours of atmospheric flight. Under 60,000 feet altitude, the UD-5 Mustang is limited to subsonic speeds. An aft-facing cargo ramp extends to the floor for loading. There are folding acceleration seats for seven troops on either side of the cargo bay. A 5-ton APC can be driven up inside the cargo bay with the seats unoccupied, and no cargo carried. The Mustang has a 20-ton hull, costs $4M and requires a pilot and crew chief.

The Enforcer M34 Helmet features a microphone, tactical camera, slide down protective visor and an integral Zenith PRC-45 short-range radio. This is exclusively military or paramilitary. Hewison M5 Integrated Combat Suit In environments where the warfighter requires complete environmental protection, Hewison Industries offers the M5 Integrated Combat Suit. This full-body suit protects from vacuum, high or low temperature, against biological or chemical agents, in unbreathable atmospheres and against radiation typically found in a hard vacuum (decreasing exposure by up to 40 rads/hr). It can support a soldier for six hours, much like a standard spacesuit, but the M5 is made of Kevlar and Salar woven layers sandwiching ceramic plates. Titanium-carbide plates reinforce vulnerable areas, and these rigid sections are backed by carbon fibre. The suit is coated with radar-absorbent neoprene polymer impregnated with conductive carbon black particles to reduce radar signature. The suit includes a Zenith PRC-45 radio, multi-beam flashlight, tethers and equipment pockets, TapTint\u2122 anti-flash visor technology and thermal masking. This last feature provides the infantryman with a modicum of stealth against infra-red sensor devices: heat is sunk into a chill can, which must be replaced after one hour of use. The M5 is exclusively frontline military. McConnell 456 Soft Suit The soft vacc suit can be used in a vacuum, but the air pressure must be reduced to prevent ballooning. This requires wearers to have spent some hours before the EVA pre-breathing oxygen. Because of this, hard suits are instead routinely used for work in a vacuum or near-vacuum. Soft suits, meanwhile, are used on planetary surfaces for protection against low pressures, radiation (decreasing exposure by up to 20 rads/hr), cold temperatures and unbreathable atmospheres. The suit has a duration of six hours. Stern B Ballistic Vest This tactical vest protects the torso and is worn over clothing. Made of woven Salar and Kevlar ballistic cloths, the vest is suitable for protection against low-calibre rounds and high-velocity fragmentation with hardened lightweight K-type ceramic inserts. In a variety of colours or camo patterns. Includes lots of pockets for carrying ammo and equipment. Stern C Concealable Vest A lightweight, soft ballistic vest for impact-resistant Salar and Kevlar fibres for the torso. The fabric absorbs impact energy and spreads it over the torso, resulting in bruising. It can be effectively concealed under regular clothing, although observers making an Int check at 8+ will notice something unusual. Tharsis A38 Hard Suit The hard vacc suit is the spacer's best friend, providing life support and protection when in space. For six hours, the suit provides a breathable atmosphere and protection from the extremes of temperature, low pressure, and radiation typically found in a hard vacuum (decreasing exposure by up to 40 rads/hr). Hard suits are rigid and have segmented joints for freedom of movement; they can operate at high pressures, which means wearers do not need to pre-breathe oxygen before use. Tharsis H200 Hostile Environment Suit Hostile environment suits are designed for conditions where a standard vacc suit would be insufficient, such as deep underwater, worlds shrouded in toxic or corrosive gases, extremes of radiation or temperature, or other locales that offer severe physical danger as well as the lack of a breathable atmosphere. HES suits provide all the life support provided by a standard vacc suit (for six hours) but are also impervious to flames, intense radiation such as that found at nuclear blast sites (decreasing radiation exposure by 90 rads/hr), and high-pressure environments like undersea trenches.","title":"Armour"},{"location":"Equipment/Military/Armour/#armour","text":"Armour reduces the amount of damage a character takes from a hit, based on the type of worn armour.

The AKZ-4 is a rugged bullpup assault rifle with a magazine holding 30 x 6.50mm rifle rounds. A large selector allows single-shot, 4 round or 10 round bursts. It is essentially the same lightweight polymer rifle as the AK-340 but now chambered for the ubiquitous 6.50mm military rifle round. Rails for scopes and other attachments are fitted on the underside of the barrel and top of the receiver. Enfield L205 Combat Rifle The new British service rifle that uses the IS 8.85mm FSDS discarding sabot bullet. The UK employs dedicated squad grenadiers and so a grenade-launcher is not not fitted. Each weapon comes with an integral Aztec 2020M scope. Part of the L200 family. Maverick M24A1 Rifle The M24A1 represents the cutting edge of American military firepower. It is an advanced assault rifle firing high-velocity 8.85mm FSDS discarding sabot bullets at 1200 metres per second. It uses an annular gas piston located around the barrel and a vertically moving bolt, making it possible to minimise the length of the receiver group and have a magazine located at the extreme rear of the weapon. A U-shaped rammer/extractor is used to chamber the caseless rounds by pushing them into the chamber. The rearward positioning of the magazine maximises the length of the barrel itself, improving both range and accuracy. Sighting is done with an integral AN/PVS-29 telescopic sight (4x magnification), which features hybrid IR and light-intensification imaging. Each caseless 5.60mm round is embedded deep within a polymer casing packed with consolidated propellant. The M24A1's electrical firing mechanism ignites this. An M340 30mm grenade launcher is mounted under the barrel, and it utilises a high-low recoilminimising propulsion system. This launcher holds four grenades, and around is loaded into the breech, ready for launching by cycling a pump-action grip. A selector above the trigger allows the firer to choose between safety, single-shot, four-round or ten round bursts. It also has a setting for the grenade launcher, which means that the grenades are fired using the same trigger as the 8.85mm rounds. The launcher makes the rifle a little front-heavy, which has earned the rifle its nickname of 'the pig' amongst US troops. Marine veterans claim PIG stands for 'Piss-poor Infantry Gun' whilst others contend it stands for a 'Pain In-the-ass Gun'. Some show a preference for the M24A3 carbine. Maverick 800 Vector With its mighty punch, accuracy and rugged construction, the Vector has found its way onto colony worlds, used by colonial forces and mercenaries across the Outer Veil. Although now looking dated, the rifle has been popular with the forces of some Earth nations and large stocks of the weapon are still available. The weapon includes in integral night-scope, a flashlight and fore-grip. The Vector can swap the fore-grip with a bipod, lose the flashlight and utilise a 32 round magazine for sustained fire use (adding 0.8kg to the weapon's weight). Noricum G2170 Binary Propellant Rifle In an effort to increase the firepower of the modern combat rifle, Noricum experimented with binary propellant fuels in the late-22nd century. The G2170 was the result. It fires full-metal jacketed rounds just like conventional rifles, but does away with the propellant part of the cartridge. In effect there is no cartridge instead it uses two types of gases which are stable on their own, but are volatile when mixed together in the G2170's ignition chamber. Sinqapore Arms SA66 The Singapore Arms SA66 is a lightweight assault rifle firing the standard military 6.50mm rifle round. The gun is sold reasonably cheaply and found in service with a host of security forces and the armed forces of small nations. It is particularly popular with colonial forces and by colonists out on frontier worlds, who need a simple, lightweight but effective rifle to hand. It incorporates a carrying handle and a simple vacuformed clamshell body. Perhaps contributing to the weapon's popularity is its lightweight, reliability, and ease of use.

This version is used by jump-jet and armoured vehicle crews who appreciate its compact design, as well as by police forces, private military contractors and rear-echelon troops (signallers, drivers and mine-clearance troops, etc.), Dispensing with the M340 grenade launcher, the carbine much lighter and it features a much shorter barrel. Due to this shortened barrel, it is less accurate and less powerful, especially at long ranges. The lighter weight also increases the recoil, despite the weapon's internal compensation. McConnell Zero-7 Gyrojet Carbine The McConnell Zero-5 is a gyrojet carbine without recoil that has been designed exclusively for personnel wearing vacuum suits. With its lack of trigger guard and easy access to the trigger, coupled with a lack of recoil (a significant hazard in low or zero-G environments), the Zero-7 has been popular on airless worlds and with some military space forces. To prevent accidental discharge, the weapon has a thumb safety at the rear of the receiver. Both must be pressed to fire the weapon. Aiming is done purely using the laser sight mounted beneath the barrel. There are no iron sights or fittings for scopes. The Zero-7 fires 1Omm solid-fuel rocket rounds, each round has four pinhole-sized nozzles angled to simulate rifling, and it burns for 5 metres before momentum takes over. Ammunition types vary, but the most common ammunition load is KEAP (Kinetic Energy Armour Piercing). which can penetrate heavy-duty vacc suits and hostile environment suits. The 10mm Gyro rounds include a dense tungsten core penetrator and are Teflon coated, which prevents the round from deforming as it strikes a hard or resilient material.

It is an advanced carbine firing high-velocity 8.85mm FSDS discarding sabot bullets at 1200 metres per second. It uses an annular gas piston located around the barrel and a vertically moving bolt, making it possible to minimise the length of the receiver group and have I magazine located at the extreme rear of the weapon. A U-shaped rammer/extractor is used to chamber the caseless rounds by pushing them into the chamber. The rearward positioning of the magazine maximises the length of the barrel itself, improving both range and accuracy. Sighting is done with an integral AN/PVS-29 telescopic sight (4x magnification), which features hybrid IR and light-intensification imaging. Each caseless 5.60mm round is embedded deep within a polymer casing packed with consolidated propellant ignited by the M24's electrical firing mechanism. This version is used by jump-jet and armoured vehicle crews who appreciate its compact design, as well as by police forces, private military contractors and rear-echelon troops (signallers, drivers and mine-clearance troops, etc.), Dispensing with the M340 grenade launcher, the carbine much lighter and it features a much shorter barrel. Due to this shortened barrel, it is less accurate and less powerful, especially at long ranges. The lighter weight also increases the recoil, despite the weapon's internal compensation.","title":"Maverick M24A2 Carbine"},{"location":"Equipment/Military/Carbines/#mcconnell-zero-7-gyrojet-carbine","text":"The McConnell Zero-5 is a gyrojet carbine without recoil that has been designed exclusively for personnel wearing vacuum suits. With its lack of trigger guard and easy access to the trigger, coupled with a lack of recoil (a significant hazard in low or zero-G environments), the Zero-7 has been popular on airless worlds and with some military space forces. To prevent accidental discharge, the weapon has a thumb safety at the rear of the receiver. Both must be pressed to fire the weapon. Aiming is done purely using the laser sight mounted beneath the barrel. There are no iron sights or fittings for scopes. The Zero-7 fires 1Omm solid-fuel rocket rounds, each round has four pinhole-sized nozzles angled to simulate rifling, and it burns for 5 metres before momentum takes over. Ammunition types vary, but the most common ammunition load is KEAP (Kinetic Energy Armour Piercing). which can penetrate heavy-duty vacc suits and hostile environment suits. The 10mm Gyro rounds include a dense tungsten core penetrator and are Teflon coated, which prevents the round from deforming as it strikes a hard or resilient material.","title":"McConnell Zero-7 Gyrojet Carbine"},{"location":"Equipment/Military/Carbines/#noricum-g2222-carbine","text":"Noricum is a British-owned firearms manufacturer. part of the Erebus conglomerate.

This smoke imposes a -2 DM on all attacks within or through the cloud (doubled for laser weapons). The smoke dissipates in 1D6x3 rounds, although high winds and other extreme weather can sharply reduce this time. M2/M2P Riot Agent Grenades The M2 riot agent grenade creates a cloud of fentanyl derivatives gas six metres in radius, centred on the location of the grenade. This fentanyl analogue will typically incapacitate anyone within the cloud that is not wearing breathing equipment. Victims must make a Very Difficult (-4) Endurance roll to avoid being knocked out for 1D6x10 minutes. Success means the victim suffers a-1 on all actions but is otherwise free to act. A roll of double-2 indicates serious injury. The victim suffers 2D6+2 damage. The gas will dissipate in 1D6x3 rounds, although high winds and other extreme weather can sharply reduce this time. M3/M3P Stun Grenades The M3 stun grenade is non-lethal and does not inflict typical damage. A character within six metres of a stun grenade detonation must make an Endurance check with a negative DM equal to the damage (after armour is subtracted). If this Endurance check is failed, the character is incapacitated for 1-3 rounds. If the Endurance check is successful, the character is unaffected by the weapon, and the stun damage is ignored. M4 Fragmentation Grenade A core of high explosive is surrounded by a layer of notched wire which fragments on detonation. The damage from fragmentation grenades decreases with distance from the blast. Distance Damage 3 metres 5D6 6 metres 3D6 9 metres 1D6 M4P Multiple Projectile Grenade The warhead of the M4P is a cup of twenty number 4 buckshot that are all released in a sabot-style design. This multiple projectile grenade effectively makes the grenade launcher a very large shotgun doing 4D6 damage to single target. Use Shotgun range and damage falloff. M5 Incendiary Grenade A phosphorous grenade burns with a white hot heat and scatters fragments of super-heated phosphorus across its 3m radius blast area. The grenade burns fiercely for 3 rounds igniting anything remotely flammable nearby. Anyone within the blast radius suffers 2D6 damage and catches fire. Used inside a vehicle or starship, the grenade will damage equipment, surfaces, and fittings. M5P High Explosive Grenades The M5 HEAP (High Explosive Armor Piercing) grenade can penetrate light armour. It can inflict severe damage against lightly armoured and civilian vehicles and bunkers, buildings and fortifications. It will reduce the target's Armour points by ten and inflict 5D6 damage. It has a blast radius of 5m, and anybody within that radius will suffer 2D6 damage. Fired from the G6 Grenade Launcher, this grenade is laser targeted and will try to home in on any target designated by the firer using the G6's integral laser painter. This provides a +1 to hit. M6P Fragmentation Airburst Grenade The M6 has similar properties to the M4 Fragmentation grenade. Still, it can be commanded to detonate in the air a target once the firer has established range to the target using the G6's laser designator. This negates the defender's -2 for shooting from cover and negates hard and total cover for a character who considers himself safe. Distance Damage 3 metres 5D6 6 metres 3D6 9 metres 1D6 M7P Baton Grenade This non-lethal round uses a sand-bag jelly to inflict blunt trauma, inflict 1D6 damage and knock over a target if they fail a Difficult Strength roll. A target knocked over is stunned for rounds before they can attempt to stand. M8P EMP Grenade EMP (or electromagnetic pulse) rounds create a massive burst of electromagnetic radiation which will not harm humans but will cause unshielded electronics within 100m of the impact point to shut down for 1D6+1 minutes. Most electronics in the setting are robust and designed to survive such flares, and thus a saving throw is allowed. Military equipment is unaffected on 5+, colonial equipment S unaffected on 8+, Earth-based civilian electronics are unaffected on a 10+. Effects are only temporary. M9P Illumination Grenade Illuminating rounds are designed to provide almost daylight intensity illumination of the immediate area. The grenade is shot into iS the air and the bright illuminating flare descends on a parachute. Thermal sights and light intensification scopes will normally cut out to protect the user's vision. The flare will take rounds to descend and illuminate a radius of 100m. M14P White Phosphorus Grenade A white phosphorous ('Willie Pete') grenade burns with a white hot heat and scatters fragments of super-heated phosphorus across its blast area. The grenade burns fiercely for 3 rounds igniting anything remotely flammable nearby. Anyone within the blast radius suffers 2D6 damage and catches fire. Used inside a vehicle or starship, the grenade will do a lot of component damage to equipment, surfaces and fittings.","title":"Grenades"},{"location":"Equipment/Military/Grenades/#grenades","text":"Item Type Damage Cost/Case (6) Mass (Individual) M1 Smoke HC Hand Special; see description 90 0.5 M2 Riot Agent Hand Special; see description 150 0.5 M3 Stun Hand 2D6 stun; see description 180 0.5 M4 Fragmentation Hand 5D6/3D6/1D6; see description 180 0.5 M5 Incendiary Hand 2d6 plus burning 160 .5 M1P Smoke HC Propelled Special; see description 90 0.5 M2P Riot Agent Propelled Special; see description 150 0.5 M3P Stun Propelled 2D6 stun; see description 180 0.5 MAP Multiple Proiectile Propelled 4D6 180 0.5 M5P High Explosive Propelled 5D6; reduce armour by 10 180 0.5 M6P Airburst Propelled 5D6/3D6/1D6; see description 180 0.5 M7P Baton Propelled 1D6 plus knockdown 90 0.5 M8P EMP Propelled Special; see description 220 0.5 M9P Illumination Propelled Special; see description 120 0.5 M14P White Phosphorus Propelled 2D6 plus burning 180 0.5","title":"Grenades"},{"location":"Equipment/Military/Grenades/#m1m1p-smoke-hc-grenades","text":"The M1 smoke grenade creates a thick cloud of coloured smoke six metres in radius, centred on the location of the grenade.

The direct fire range of the MLT is only 30m, but any target hit is automatically on fire. Targets beyond 30m (and out to its extreme range of 50m) can only be hit by indirect fire, angling the weapon at an angle and letting the jet of napalm fall on the target. The victim takes 2D6 damage immediately. The burning character must make another Difficult (-2) Dexterity check in each subsequent round. Failure means he takes another 2D6 damage that round.

If the character has no such means, rolling on the ground or smothering the fire with cloaks or the like permits the character a DM+2 on his next Dexterity check. M9 Eagle-Eye Disposable Missile The M9 is a disposable missile carried in the field by a single infantryman. It is 3.2kg and only 64cm long, telescoping out to 90cm for use. Prep to fire requires four combat rounds in total. To counteract the weapon's recoil, the missile launcher channels exhaust backwards in an explosive backblast. Anyone up to 2 metres behind a rocket launcher takes 3D6 damage from the exhaust when it fires. The M9 Eagle-Eye contains a High Explosive Anti-Tank warhead to destroy light and medium armour and is guided onto the target by an infra-red guidance system. This provides a +3 DM to hit unless the guidance computer cannot lock on, is confused by decoys or has no IR signature to identify (such as with a bunker or supply dump).

Tracking is via both a motion tracker and an infra-red sensor mounted above and below the barrel that sends target images to the user's smart goggles connected to the gun via cable and jack. Supplied by an ammunition drum holding 250 rounds of 9x28mm caseless, the IMAG Hydra is used to provide suppressive fire, to deal with armoured troops, equipment, and soft-skinned vehicles. It does this with a slightly larger and more powerful round than used in the M24 series of rifles. The 9x28mm round is designated as HE (high explosive), giving the squad a real punch. Herstal-Nationale HN141 Heavy Machine Gun Herstal-Nationale, a European tools and firearms manufacturer, designed the famous HN141 almost a hundred years ago. Adopted by many militaries, including China, Japan and the US (as the M6 HMG), it is in still in service today, though mainly used on vehicles. Lighter coilguns look set to replace it. It feeds from a side-hopper that holds a single 200-round ammunition belt. Maverick M68 LMG The M68 is a light machinegun variant of the standard M24A1 advanced combat rifle. The M68 is fitted with a longer and heavier barrel that can cope with sustained burst fire without overheating to fulfil its role as a squad support weapon. In addition, the grenade launcher has been dropped in favour of a folding bipod, used to support the gun as it provides covering fire for the rest of the squad during fire and movement operations. Like the M24A1, the M68 fires high velocity 8.85mm FSDS discarding sabot bullets at 1200 metres per second. It uses an annular gas piston located around the barrel and a vertically moving bolt, making it possible to minimise the length of the receiver group and have a magazine located at the extreme rear of the weapon. A U-shaped rammer/extractor is used to chamber the caseless rounds by pushing them into the chamber. The rearward positioning of the magazine maximises the length of the barrel itself, improving both range and accuracy. Sighting is done with an integral AN/PVS-29 telescopic sight (4x magnification), which features hybrid IR and light-intensification imaging. Each caseless 5.60mm round is embedded deep within a polymer casing (of 8.85mm calibre) packed with consolidated propellant ignited by the M68's electrical firing mechanism. The barrel is fitted with a flash suppressor to minimise the gun's signature when under observation from hostile forces. Steyr-Brandt StG 340 The Steyr-Brandt StG 340 is a heavy assault rifle used either as a light machinegun or with the bipod removed and the ammo hopper swapped for a 30 round box magazine, like an assault rifle. Quick conversion to a rifle lightens the gun to 4kg. The StG 340 fires the modern high-velocity 8.85mm discarding sabot bullet at 1200 metres per second. Each caseless 5.60mm sabot round is embedded deep within a polymer casing (of 8.85mm calibre) packed with consolidated propellant and ignited by the Steyr's electrical firing mechanism.

Voroncovo M5A5 Auto Coilgun A development of the M33 sniper coil gun, the Auto Coilgun is a heavy machinegun used in anti-aircraft defence as an auxiliary weapon on many types of military vehicles. The weapon overcomes the power dependencies of the M33 by relying on the powerplant of its host vehicle. Auto Coilguns can also be mounted onto a tripod (mass 15kg) as an infantry support gun, and these are supplied with an M2 CAPSU (Combined Ammunition and Power Supply Unit). Like the M33, the fully automatic M5A5 accelerates ferrous rounds through electromagnetic coils powered by a high-energy liquid-metallic suspension battery. The 12mm rounds are loaded into the gun via a flexible ammunition belt that feeds from a side-mounted hopper. The high velocities attained by the coilgun produce flat and very accurate trajectories. The weapon can use various types of ammunition.

Folding Spade The military folding spade or 'entrenching tool' has been used in many conflicts as a last resort weapon, from Julius Caesar's days to the Vietnam War. It is short, with a sharp cutting blade and can be wielded in hand-to-hand combat if no other weapon is at hand. The spade is 60 cm long but folds down to 24 cm and fits within a polymer carrier for mounting on a rucksack or belt. Machete A large, heavy, single-edged knife used in cutting vegetation to clear a campsite. It can also be used as a large camp or field knife. It is generally carried in a belt sheath. Machetes are more survival tools than weapons and are often found in emergency kits, lifeboats etc. Spike Any improvised weapon with a point or spike on end. A short spike is classed as anything up to 1 metre in length, while a long spike is any pointed improvised weapon between 1 and 3 metres in length.","title":"Melee Weapons"},{"location":"Equipment/Military/Melee_Weapons/#melee-weapons","text":"Item Cost Mass Range DM DMG Unarmed Strike - - melee (close quarters) 0 1D6 Short Club - 1 melee (close quarters) 0 2D6 Long Club - 2 melee (extended reach) -1 2D6 Knife, Expedition 60 0.25 melee (close quarters) 0 2D6 Knife, Combat 120 0.25 melee (close quarters) +1 2D6 Short Spike - 1 melee (close quarters) -1 2D6 Long Spike - 1.5 melee (extended reach) -1 2D6 Axe, Expedition 30 2.5 melee (extended reach) -1 3D6 Folding Spade 30 1.5 melee (close quarters) -2 2D6 Machete 50 0.35 melee (extended reach) -1 3D6","title":"Melee Weapons"},{"location":"Equipment/Military/Melee_Weapons/#axe","text":"A heavy axe used by fire-fighters, loggers, carpenters, expedition team members, etc. It makes a devastating weapon but is not balanced for hand-to-hand fighting.

Chulai Type 56 Pistol Manufactured by Chulai, a Chinese arms company, the Type 56 saw extensive export throughout the Asia Pacific Partnership as a 'man-stopper', popular with police and security forces. t includes an integral laser sight. The Chulai Type 56 was initially chambered in China's popular 5.8mm armour-piercing round, but export versions were rechambered for the .44, which is more common. McConnell Zero-5 Gyrojet Pistol The McConnell Zero-5 is gyrojet pistol without recoil that has been designed exclusively for personnel wearing vacuum suits. With its lack of trigger guard and easy of access to the trigger, coupled with a lack of recoil (a significant hazard in low or zero-G environments). the Zero-5 found a ready market on the Frontier. To prevent accidental lo discharge, the weapon has a thumb safety at the rear of the receiver. Both must be pressed to fire the weapon. Aiming is done purely using the laser sight mounted beneath the barrel. There are no iron sights or fittings for scopes. The Zero-5 fires 10mm solid-fuel rocket rounds, each round has four pinhole-sized nozzles angled to simulate rifling, and it burns for 5 metres before momentum takes over. Ammunition types vary, but the most common ammunition load is KEAP (kinetic energy armor piercing). which can penetrate heavy-duty vac suits and hostile environment suiis. The Omm Gyro rounds include t dense tungsten core penetrator and are Teflon coated, which prevents the round from deforming as it strikes a hard or resilient material. Stern Weapons VP90 The VP90 is a reliable 10mm machine pistol that has been re-designed and re-engineered many times over the past fifty years, but the design is a strong one. Its reliability and accuracy have never been bettered and used as a US Marine sidearm and close protection firearm for security troops throughout human-explored space. It features a double-column in the magazine (to cram in 10 x 22mm Corta bullets) and a high-impact plastic receiver. Williams Auto Redhawk Model 4 The Williams Auto Redhawk Model 4 is one of the most popular auto pistols. Capable of single-shot, it also has a burst-fire option for more accurate fire. The 10x22m Corta rounds have a lethality that security forces and police units appreciate across human space, but the round is still just about manageable in burst mode. Of course, auto fire in a weapon this size requires some skill. Williams Arms recommend a two-handed hold on the gun. A later development, the Model 5, was designed to improve the otherwise lacklustre accuracy of the Model 4.

Williams Model 9 Stun Gun Twenty-third-century stun guns use focused sonic waves to disorientate and incapacitate their victims. They are a non-lethal alternative to handguns, easy to handle with no recoil, but useful only at short range. When hit by the Stun Gun, a target makes an End roll with a DM penalty equal to the damage rolled. Subtract armour from this damage. If failed, the target is unconscious for 1D6 minutes.

The gun is an adaptation of the SA66 assault rifle and is primarily used as a survival rifle, found on-board rovers and shuttles and in survival kits. It has a semi-automatic action and a simple vac formed clamshell body. Perhaps contributing to the weapon's popularity is its light weight, reliability and its ease of use. Stern Universal T51 This semi-automatic rifle fires one round for every trigger pull. It fires powerful 7.78 \u00d7 52 bullets with some accuracy out to 1200m. The Universal T51 is popular with security sharpshooters, foresters and colonists who need a rifle for survival and hunting. A snug, form-fitting eight-shot magazine is inserted forward of the trigger assembly. Integral optical sights come as standard, but they can be removed. The entire rifle can be easily disassembled and stored within a purpose-made impact-resistant carry-box. The intention was for the gun to remain pristine when not used during activities in the colonies (bouncing around in ATVs or thrown in the back of a temporary pressurised base). This ability to break down the T51 has seen it gain some use with assassins out on the frontier. Voroncovo M33 Coilgun The Voroncovo corporation has introduced a new magnetic coil technology, bringing magnetic acceleration to the infantryman's battlefield. The coilgun is a large calibre sniper and anti-material rifle that accelerates ferrous rounds through electromagnetic coils powered by a high-energy liquid-metallic suspension battery. Discarding sabot rounds are loaded into the gun in a 10 round magazine to the rear of the trigger assembly. Each is a 12mm HVADS (High-Velocity Accelerated Discarding Sabot) given imparted spin using bias in the magnetic field. After leaving the barrel, the sabots fall away to reveal the 9.46mm teardrop-shaped bullet that consists of hardened steel, surrounded by a softer copper jacket with a hollow-point tip. The combination of high-velocity (upwards of 1400 metres per second), hollow-point tip and dense core give the round superb stopping power and an effective armour-piercing capability. The limit on coil gun technology is the dependence on a high-energy power source, and so the M33 is a precision sniper rifle and not a weapon that will not be firing hundreds of rounds a minute.","title":"Rifles"},{"location":"Equipment/Military/Rifles/#rifles","text":"Item Calibre Cost Mass ROF Range DMG Recoil Length Rounds Singapore Arms SA7 Survival Rifle 6.5mm 500 2.6 1 Assault 3D6 6+ 75 20 Stern Universal T51 Rifle 7.78mm 1200 3.4 1 Rifle 3D6+2 6+ 99 8 Voroncovo M33 Coilgun 12mm HVADS 3000 5.5 1 Rifle 4D6+2 8+ 103 10","title":"Rifles"},{"location":"Equipment/Military/Rifles/#singapore-arms-sa7-survival-rifle","text":"The Singapore Arms SA7 is lightweight survival rifle firing the standard military 6.50mm rifle round.

The nations of Earth had over-reached themselves, however, and much of the cost of the space effort was tendered out to Southern Cross Mining. Likewise, Luna had divested itself of the burden of maintaining mining outposts and space colonies, offering the enterprises to the Reiner-Gamma Corporation. Within a decade or two Earth and Luna were politically united, but the human race was under an immense population and resource pressure. Reiner-Gama soon swallowed up Southern Cross and dominated the solar system, supplying petroleum and minerals to Earth at any price it chose. The other, major /corporations of Earth put their faith in a new breakthrough, the quantum hyperspace tunnelling effect, and after the first hyperspace ship returned from Alpha Centauri in 2120, were soon building ships able to scout out resources in neighbouring star systems. We had a Faster-Than-Light drive! The First Recession [2166-2170] After the creation of an interstellar drive, a scramble for the stars ensued as mining and oil drilling companies desperately sought out resources that they could supply to Earth thereby skirting Reiner-Gama's near monopoly within the Solar System. Within thirty years there were twenty flourishing colonies within parsecs of Earth and dozens of small outposts and mining installations. On Earth, stresses were beginning to show within the world government of the Earth Union. The Chinese Communist Party initiated greatly-needed and wide-ranging reforms but these could not stem the economic and social problems that had piled up over the past four decades. In 2166 the Communist Party was abolished and amid political turmoil a new, more democratic government, was established. Earth, tied intimately into the Chinese economy was plunged into the First Recession, the world government reacted poorly, and lost the confidence of many nations. China broke apart, just as the Earth Union itself collapsed. Manchuria successfully seceded from the 'new' China to create the People's Republic of Guandong. Various autonomous regions in the far west, including Tibet and Xinjiang, followed suit. The economic heartland of China, the wealthy and well populated east coast styled itself as the Federal Republic of China. The chaos lasted for a decade, and within that time of uncertainty and of a shrinking China, Japan and its powerful corporations stepped up. Japan had itself undergone social and economic transformation starting twenty years earlier, and had tackled systemic problems of an aging population, a shrinking population and a reliance on foreign raw materials. With controlled immigration from within the Asia-Pacific region, and renewed focus on automation, robotics and artificial intelligence technologies to increase productivity, Japan was looking boldly into the future. As China entered its time of crisis and First Recession began to bite, Japan was able to show leadership in the region and formed the Asia Pacific Partnership in an attempt to weather the storm. China had lost its lead in the region Japan once again dominated the Far Eastern area. In 2170 the major corporations of the world came together in Singapore to create the United Corporate Combine essentially a standing inter-corporate council. The Combine's first task was to establish agencies which would regulate international business and practices, something the United Nations had once done, and that the Earth Union had then continued. The Earth Union had ceased to exist in all but name two years earlier at the height of the First Recession. Corporations now seemed to wield the most power on and off of Earth, and their 'voters' were their customers. Nations relied on these industrial giants for both their valuable business and their lucrative investments. The Second Recession (2200-2215) The nations of Earth would need these resources, as, in 2200, the oil reserves dried up (or at least became unprofitable to exploit). Oil was desperately needed, not for fuel, since most vehicles ran from hydrogen fuel cells and power-stations were fusion-based and required helium-3. Petroleum was needed by the plastics and the chemicals industries. Bioplastic was n use, but its reliance on vegetable matter grown in fields that could otherwise be used to feed starving millions, meant that oil, tried and tested over centuries and understood by all chemical engineers and plant designers, remained the primary choice. Now oil reserves on distant moons and on harsh planets would have to provide a source for that oil. The Oil Crisis of 2200 initiated a Second Recession lasting for 15 years. Some colonies and outposts were temporarily abandoned due to cost-saving exercises. In Macapa, Brazil, an extraordinary construction was begun: a vast oil pipeline stretching from the surface all the way to the edge of the atmosphere and beyond out to a distant orbit. This Trans Atmospheric Petroleum Pipeline (TAPP) was funded by a unique corporate consortium for the Community of American States. it was a statement: 'once this pipeline is completed the recession will end. And end it did. Oil flowed, prices dropped, economies began to flourish and a new era began in human history. The colonization of space was not some great altruistic project, an attempt to 'spread humanity across the stars' or to 'explore the unknown', it was all about profit. No nation could justify such an undertaking, and SO the corporations sought their profits out there on asteroids and icy moons, on planets good and bad. Mineral extraction, logging and oil drilling were the big industries in space and a vast infrastructure of tugs, space stations, cargo starships, spaceports and terminals was constructed. Insurrection on Tau Ceti (2215-Present) Colonies were established, mostly within parsecs of Earth, but these large-scale settlements today typically service the extraction industries operating out toward the Outer Rim and beyond. Most serve as way stations and technical bases for the large corporations and their space enterprises. The oldest of the Off-World colonies, Tau Ceti, has been plunged into war during the past decade. The planet had been settled separately by two nations: China and the United States of America, but with the fall of China during the First Recession, the Chinese colony was abandoned. Only after the recession did brutal counter-insurgency war on Tau Ceti begin factions supported by the new competing Chinese nations struggled to capture Shulin, the Chinese colony. When the UCC ruled that only independence for Tau Ceti (both American and Chinese colonies) would end the crisis, the United States was invited to act as peacekeeper within the Chinese colony, until a stable government could be formed and independence for Tau Ceti organized. From that moment in 2215, the Chinese factions turned on the American peacekeepers with great ferocity. The USA has gotten embroiled in a savage counter-insurgency that is costing thousands of lives every year and trillions of dollars annually. Washington cannot let the Chinese colony fail, to do so would endanger the safety and security of the successful American colony, Lindbergh, on the same world. With the Chinese and American colonies both united and independent, the USA would have a strong and powerful pro-American ally in the Near Earth Zone. Eco Collapse The impact of ten billion people and their high technology lifestyles had a great impact on planet Earth, and then of course there has been the effect of global warming a fact, no matter what its source. The late 22nd century saw rising sea levels, droughts and rampant desertification, with millions of hectares of farmland being lost to the encroaching sand dunes. Climates began a permanent shift; large parts of the United States, for example, have become hot, almost rainless and dry. A blistering sun kills crops in the fields and scorching winds blow in desert sands to cover them over. Many American cities suffer from water shortages making life hard for the poorest in society. Expert water management in North America has prevented this climatic shift from becoming a agricultural catastrophe, however, and intensive farming can still continue to feed the people in the cities. While America and Europe bravely struggle to stave off total eco-collapse, there are many nations that have failed. Kyrgyzstan has been thoroughly 'desertified', as has Mali, Chad and the Sonoran region of Mexico. Many American cities are dry and dusty; a bourbon-colored haze fills the air, cutting visibility to only a few miles. On bad days only the tops of distant skyscrapers and arcologies can be seen rising up above the orange-brown smog. 'You don't have to go to other stars to find a planet where the atmosphere is trying to kill you,' said senator Terry Enderman, famously. 'The air above L.A. is as nasty as it gets. Drop a 21st century Angelino in here and I bet they'd classify it as \"alien\".' Today the corporations are all-mighty; they wield power and budgets that dwarf many nations on Earth. And much of their power comes from their role as suppliers of petroleum, helium-3, minerals and other raw materials to an ever-hungry (and ever growing) population. Reiner-Gama has claimed by force much of the solar system as a corporate preserve, and it continues to supply Earth with valuable raw materials \u2022 at a price.

In 2170 the United Corporate Combine (the UCC, or simply 'Combine') was established. It is a permanent council for arbitration and corporate law that was established by the major corporations to handle matters of international and interstellar law. It manages several offices which focus on specific areas, including the Mining Regulation Commission (MRC), the Interstellar Commerce Organization (ICO) and the Extra-Solar Colonization Administration (ESDA). Several of Earth's corporations are extremely powerful; like the nations that they feed from, many have abandoned public shareholdings. The most powerful are privately owned, run by families and clans. Each corporation is comprised of multiple companies with robust internal transactions, all controlled by a single, near all-powerful chairman that acts both as manager and de-facto owner of the entire enterprise. Each is vertically organized, with manufacturing, supply, finance and banking, and distribution all in-house. Sub-companies are created to run these sectors and benefit the umbrella organization. The bank and general trading company sit at the heart of the corporation. Typical concerns of a corporation are banking, insurance, steel, trading, manufacturing, electronics, gas and power, chemical and interstellar development and ship-building. The general trading company (the heart) concerns itself with logistics, plant development, and both international and interstellar resource exploration. These corporations trade in many markets (or diversify) for security, and all the component companies own shares in one another's companies, thus preventing hostile take-overs, allowing the monitoring and disciplining of firms and easing pressure on management, allowing the corporation to focus on long-term goals. These 23nd century corporations resemble the South Korean chaebol and the Japanese keiretsu of the 21st century, both of which formed in the post-war world of the 1950s. All the corporations have plenty of power on Earth amongst the political blocs, and everyone knows that if they fail, they bring the global economies down with them. Many politicians are also sponsored by these corporations. They are powerful: who regulates a transnational company if not a transnational body that is transparent and responsive to global stakeholders? Such a body does not exist. The UN was disbanded long-ago. The Big Seven Many of Earth's corporations are extremely powerful, often rivaling in economic power the nations that they feed from. The most powerful are conglomerates. A conglomerate is a corporation that is made up of a number of different, seemingly unrelated businesses. On near-future Earth, the corporations are master. Every important or well-paid or job here is within such a mega-corporation. A vast percentage of jobs are either in these corporations or one of their subsidiaries or suppliers. Their employees, shareholders and pensioners are at the top of society. Below them are the independent businessmen and other professionals who deal regularly with the corporation and are on good terms with them.

In 2170 the United Corporate Combine (the UCC, or simply 'Combine') was established. It is a permanent council for arbitration and corporate law that was established by the major corporations to handle matters of international and interstellar law. It manages several offices which focus on specific areas, including the Mining Regulation Commission (MRC), the Interstellar Commerce Organization (ICO) and the Extra-Solar Colonization Administration (ESDA). Several of Earth's corporations are extremely powerful; like the nations that they feed from, many have abandoned public shareholdings. The most powerful are privately owned, run by families and clans. Each corporation is comprised of multiple companies with robust internal transactions, all controlled by a single, near all-powerful chairman that acts both as manager and de-facto owner of the entire enterprise. Each is vertically organized, with manufacturing, supply, finance and banking, and distribution all in-house. Sub-companies are created to run these sectors and benefit the umbrella organization. The bank and general trading company sit at the heart of the corporation. Typical concerns of a corporation are banking, insurance, steel, trading, manufacturing, electronics, gas and power, chemical and interstellar development and ship-building. The general trading company (the heart) concerns itself with logistics, plant development, and both international and interstellar resource exploration. These corporations trade in many markets (or diversify) for security, and all the component companies own shares in one another's companies, thus preventing hostile take-overs, allowing the monitoring and disciplining of firms and easing pressure on management, allowing the corporation to focus on long-term goals. These 23nd century corporations resemble the South Korean chaebol and the Japanese keiretsu of the 21st century, both of which formed in the post-war world of the 1950s. All the corporations have plenty of power on Earth amongst the political blocs, and everyone knows that if they fail, they bring the global economies down with them. Many politicians are also sponsored by these corporations. They are powerful: who regulates a transnational company if not a transnational body that is transparent and responsive to global stakeholders? Such a body does not exist. The UN was disbanded long-ago.","title":"Rise of the Corporations"},{"location":"Setting/Rise_of_the_Corporations/#the-big-seven","text":"Many of Earth's corporations are extremely powerful, often rivaling in economic power the nations that they feed from.

Why aren't they in that setting? How do we rationalize a future, some two centuries hence, where cell-phones, plasma screens and wi-fi just don't exist? An Alternate Future As in our current time, technology in the HOSTILE setting looked on the verge of a virtual electronics developmental explosion as the 1970s gave way to the 1980s but a series of seemingly minor circumstances and major historical events hampered what might have been a wondrous new age and changed the course of human history. As President George Bush gave his now famous Space Exploration Initiative speech on July 20, 1989 and launched an enterprise that would send mankind out into the solar system and beyond, there were already factors affecting the technologies that would take them there. The Decline of Moore's Law Moore's Law is \"the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years.\" In April 2005, Gordon Moore stated that the projection cannot be sustained indefinitely: \"It can't continue forever. The nature of exponentials is that you push them out and eventually disaster happens.\" The ongoing miniaturization and improvement of integrated circuits therefore slowed dramatically as the 20th century came to a close. Dreams of micro-electronic components and palm-sized super computers crashed as improvements in computer technology were slaved to large main-frame processors and bulky terminals. Now, mechanical and electrical engineering would have to take up the slack and become the main agent of technological progress. Network Insecurities Rampant security breaches and the hacking of civilian, commercial, industrial and governmental data networks cost those affected billions and on more than one occasion threatened world-wide economic collapse. As a result a compartmentalizing and decentralization of databanks was instituted as well as a shift from risky wireless connectivity to a more secure hard-wire format. Transmitted data, when necessary for a given application, was sent by tight-beam data-burst or secure carrier frequencies. While wireless networks are common today, in the retrofuture of the HOSTILE setting such technology is just too risky. Wireless networks can be too easily spied on, jammed and spoofed, etc. This makes a smartphone full of personal information a liability, not an asset. The open trading of computer files on a network is not something that the governments, corporations, or other organizations support. There is an increased reliability on material memory disks instead of virtual data storage as a high-security means of data management. If someone buys or sells music, video, or software, it's typically In person with a disc, not via the network. Network engineers, hackers, and technicians may use a computer tied into a network, but the average person does not, except to use email or videophones. The Flight 926 Incident On May 12th, 2029 an Emirates Boeing 777 exploded just off the cost of Qatar en-route to Cairo. The 1.7 megaton nuclear device vaporized the 378 passengers and crew, contaminated thousands with far-spreading fallout, and devastated the region's power grid and electrical services for months. Long term casualty estimates were nightmarish and the effect on petroleum production and trade from the EMP alone was a universal calamity. The radical religious zealots responsible for the tragedy were identified and brought to justice but the effects of the disaster were far reaching. The vulnerability of solid state technology to EMP emissions on such a wide scale prompted a manufacturing frenzy towards more secure, EMP resistant and dependable alternatives. The resulting technology succeeded in these aims but at a cost of performance, power requirements and most of all size. The revolution began a design and developmental trend that would see heavier, bulkier and sturdier electronic devices in every application and a closer symmetry with mechanical alternatives. The limited but still catastrophic East Asian Nuclear conflict in 2047 only served to entrench the need for such an institutional shift and established manufacturing principles for the next century. Development of the Vacuum Channel Transistor At the onset of the 21st century, NASA engineers tinkered with an odd new technology, the Vacuum Channel Transistor (VCT) which was essentially a high-tech a version of the old vacuum tube that had been all but made extinct by the onset of solid state electronics in the 60s. The VCT utilized a field-emission principle and was faster, more powerful and lacked many of the vulnerabilities of its electronic rivals including operation at high temperatures and tolerance to high dose radiation. When coupled with developments in carbon nanotube heat transfer the new technology sparked a subtle revolution as processing operating frequencies in the terahertz range became possible. The answer to the failing solid state market had been found with one major disadvantage. VCT technology was bulky and heavy and required additional supportive hardware that ended the steady migration to smaller and lighter electronics that had dominated for decades. The future of electronics would be bright and unimaginably efficient, but it would be big. Design Paradigm As a result of the previous events and other lesser factors electronic design and development in the HOSTILE setting took a decidedly different direction to our own. As man took his first major steps into space and Earth embraced the challenges of the new century the tools, vehicles and devices they held dear took on a new dimension, one formed by the nature of their construction. Solid and well-made was the new design format. Perhaps heavy and unwieldy by the standards of the late 20th century, the new designs were simply accepted as a matter of need, and embraced as the next generation of electronics. Style followed purpose and as the decades passed the new 'industrial' appeal became common place. A certain, popular, 'retro-tech' trend spread throughout the world's key manufacturers and design choices were quick to reflect it. Chic, streamlined, stylish consumer electronics in glass and minimalist-style cases were never popular, gaining the instant reputation as cheap toys, gimmicks and gifts. Consumers wanted their equipment to look like it was up to the job, and so the mantra went: \"if it looked right then it was right!\" Patterns of construction emerged and the manufacturing climate took on a distinct, workaday tone. Electronic development vaulted ahead and with the space-race fulling innovation, technology enjoyed a new renaissance but snuggly within the blueprint set by those early years of re-innovation. Mechanical contrivance rivalled the electronic for the first time in decades and the offspring of the two would carry human kind to the stars. Mechanical alternatives to electronic applications were popularized and control schemes returned to concepts thought to be on the way out. Buttons, dials and toggle switches replaced touch screens and keyboard commands while gauges and meters took the place of multi-purpose LCD screens and computer based monitoring. Pneumatics and hydraulics surged ahead of magnetic engineering as cost effective and efficient alternatives to the now almost as bulky electronic versions. Engines once dominated by computerized regulation were designed with auto-mechanical management instead, increasing performance and reliability but size and weight as well. Almost forgotten elements of modern society driven out decades earlier by modern tech were here and there revived. Retro-Engineering Following a world-wide trend manufacturers and developers began designing and building with larger, heavier and mechanically domineering elements to offset the decline of micro-electronics. Servos, motors, ventilation equipment, pumps, coolant and heating, engines, batteries, power generation, product delivery lines and every component in modern engineering began to take on this initially subtle but increasingly imposing aspect. Solid-state construction principles gave way to a combination of new bold electronics and mechanical engineering converting the once minute and fragile to sturdy and imposing devices. Hydraulic and pneumatic equipment is everywhere, replacing electric motors in many applications. Motorized power equipment, run by internal combustion motors or separate generators is also prevalent with many industrial applications perpetually accompanied by the hum, drone or rumble of a supporting motor. Electrical lines are larger, thicker and carry more current and many more are necessary for a single a application. Manually powered back up provisions are also plentiful with crankcapacitors, hand pumped hydraulics and the like present on most critical equipment. The structures built to support this technology are heavier, industry grade designs, sporting massive frames, thick insulating material, extensive venting and sizeable access spaces. Lighting is sparse, inefficient and often unreliable. Confined to outdated construction methods fluorescent, Zenon and even incandescent fixtures still predominate with LEDS and other advanced lighting equipment left behind with the transistor. The pale luminescence of back lit readouts and instrumentation are often accompanied only by the flicker of a failing fluorescent overhead. In general the electrical and mechanical technology of the 22nd century and beginning of the 23rd resembles that of the heavy industrial construction prevalent in the late 20th in most respects, despite enjoying the developmental improvements in principle and function of the years that followed. This is as much a feature of necessity and purpose as it is one of style and custom. There were clear reasons for the shift in the beginning but after a generation design followed design and as the decades passed new trends followed old ones without any clear motivation to change and every reason to build on established methods. Off-World Needs While the retrofuture of the HOSTILE setting makes certain specific stylistic choices in a nod to the source material from which it takes its inspiration, it is a game largely focused on the lives of workers, explorers, and space-farers in the regions of space far from Earth. That IS, on life off-world. This is an incredibly difficult environment for computers and electronics, which might be exposed to radiation, solar flares, gravity fluctuations, and other elements of utterly alien environments. Silica, dust, methane gas, or thousand other substances could ruin a machine in a matter of minutes or even seconds. The gadgets need to operate in the most unforgiving environments that humans will encounter. This means that the equipment used offworld needs to be 'over-engineered' in comparison to electronics on Earth. While a citizen of Tokyo might enjoy comparatively light and handy consumer electronics, the platform workers on Tau Ceti will have little use for such items. Off-world devices are, above all, robust, easy to use, and easy to repair. If a critical device breaks it could cause injuries or even deaths. Heavy cabling, thick cases, and simple displays are the name of the game. If everything looks like it belongs in an industrial setting it that's because it does! Likewise, the software and repair support for consumer electronics iS just not available. Smartphones and their apps may be ubiquitous in 2018, but in a distant colonial world without easy connectivity and the servers and upgrades to keep them working, such devices are all but useless, and mostly unnecessary. Old fashioned, hard-wired phones work perfectly fine, even when the electromagnetic environment would block a cell phone call. Better to have a powerful backpack radio or satellite link that can reach across a continent, even during a thunderstorm or ionospheric flare-up, than a tiny pocket radio that needs an expensive radio tower network to carry i message.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Technology/#introduction","text":"Look at those cathode-ray tube monitors in Alien and Outland, marvel at the lack of flat-screen technology, touch-screen computers, cell-phones and a hundred other modern marvels.

Confined by the same electronic principles that hindered their electronic cousins they were little more than programmable machines in human form. It was not until startling developments in wetware science and accompanying biorobotics emerged in the mid-22nd century that the dream of a true android became a reality. Through bioengineering specific cell structures, programming individual neurons and artificially sequencing DNA strands, a biological element was introduced into the otherwise electromechanical construction of the first android body and then the brain. The result was more than an advanced CPU, it was a fully functional biocomputer a synthetic organism. Technically it was a cyborg, as it contained both organic and synthetic components these androids, released for sale in 2170, were an entirely new construct, the offspring of a whole new technology, all the way down to the cellular level. Transdyne Cybersystems led the research and development in this new field for decades and was quick to seize both legal a copyright and a manufacturing and marketing monopoly on the technology. All legally manufactured androids are Transdyne models without exception. Programming has steadily improved from the earliest Alpha models that could acknowledge and respond to a limited list of verbal commands only, to the fully interactive and emotive Gamma models of the 2190s. It was in 2209 however that the first sentient computer was brought online, not by Transdyne however but by rival. Four years later the rival company was forced into bankruptcy and all of their assets, research and the prototype AI became the property of TDC. The move was not swift enough to stop the appearance of a number of sentient computer core designs with various corporate labels (Leyland Okuda, for example) but it assured TDC was at the forefront of new AI development. In 2214 the new Epsilon-series was launched as the first truly sentient, synthetic life form. The Epsilon-series android was a not simply a self-aware computer, however. Several models of AI-CPU had earned that distinction first and were already performing services in a number of applications, from industry to research and even spacecraft mainframe monitoring and control. These fully responsive and intelligent machines were marvels in their own right but the unique nature and construction of the Transdyne androids took this technology to an amazing and truthfully unexpected apex. When coupled with the wetware convergence of machine and organic construction the android became more than aware, it was sentient, for all pretences, alive. What the bio-electronic brain lacked in conventional memory and processing, it expanded in ways even the technicians could not have anticipated. Each android began to develop, immediately upon activation, as an individual. Attempts to install the android consciousness into traditional computer roles proved disastrous, the subjects developing destabilizing neurosis or simply shutting down from the stress. When given the opportunity to perform as an individual however, they often exceeded their programming, achieving a level of sophistication that what not unlike the beginnings of personality. The Epsilon-series is now in its 7th model and has performed beyond all expectations. Androids have found : place not only as functional assistants but have demonstrated the ability to act independently, form relationships and enhance their initial programming. They remain somewhat restricted in the area of expressed emotion and it is still believed by most that what the android may express as preference, opinion, or creative thought is still just a matter of programmed behavioural algorithms. There is a movement by some however to grant androids status as living beings as with generations the distinction between artificial and actual life form becomes more blurred. Android Fabrication The modern android is human-like, electro-mechanical cyborg designed for harsh conditions or monotonous tasks (or both). Built around a sturdy carbon fiber skeleton is a complex system of silicon muscles that stabilizes and controls. An outer covering of bio-plastic sheeting is built up on top of a layer of flexible collagenous fibers. The most modern androids operate with a Model/4 computer running either a level 1, 2 or 3 Intellect program. To calculate an android's Intelligence in comparison to a human, add 5 to its Intellect program level (giving it a character Intelligence characteristic of 6-8). An android's social standing stands at a default level of 0. Power is provided for around three months by a 25 kW fuel cell requiring a liquid hydrogen fuel. Obviously, androids do not need to breath, drink or eat, but they do occasionally ingest a pale-coloured, semi-organic nutrient suspension in a siliconbased liquid medium; this serves as a lubricant for the system's micro-hydraulics. Some attempt to fit in' to their mission teams by eating and drinking at meal-times, these nutrients will pass through the system harmlessly until emptied by the android. Such an ability allows an android to blend in seamlessly, even covertly. The machinery, processor, fuel cell and carefully designed outer skin can be damaged, so it is prudent for androids to wear vacc suits or hostile environment suits. Vacuum, high pressure, high temperature and aggressive atmospheric chemical constituents can all irreparably damage an android. The cost of single unit precludes the avoidable and wasteful use of an android in such an environment. Most androids are competent and of average human intelligence. They are generally programmed with passive, non-aggressive personalities and are typically given the likeness of a mature (30-40 year-old) male or female. The aim is to blend in, to join in, to be team-player within a group of humans, supporting the leadership and providing useful options and advice without being forceful. Androids cannot harm humans and follow Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics. Fifth generation (Epsilon-series) androids can be bought as stock models for a competitive price, or the customer cn customize his android from parts available at the factory. This only applies to the most recent series of TDC androids. Custommade units are ready for delivery within 6-10 months. Buyers must specify their preferred options. Repair Station : Androids require an upright repair station, massing around 200 kg into which the android itself, steps. A transparent lid then closes, and the android plugs in, and undergoes a diagnostic and lubricant change; the fuel cell is topped up with if liquid hydrogen also, if needed. Typically, androids will require a check-up every month or sO, or after sustaining damage. Minor damage can usually be repaired in 1-6 hours. Next Generation Androids AI technology such as that found in androids is biological computer or wetware core processor which creates a volitional thinking machine, neural network with high level of cognition. For the incredible complexity of free thought, creativity, problem solving, and volitional action to work reliably and stably over time, it was found to work most efficiently in form which mirrored the neurological structure of the human brain. The Transdyne android brain is formed around artificially constructed neurons and electrode pairs. It uses electrical signals to read and write to the neurons, which are kept at a stable temperature and PH level, etc. A fully sapient android brain has billions of these artificial neurons, with numbers approximating that of a human brain. Lower levels of complexity can create sentience, even primitive reasoning, but fifth generation Transdyne androids (and perhaps others) possesses truly human-like levels of brain power. Generation Remarks Characteristics Typical Price Alpha (2170) Simple tasks, novelty and curiosity value; crude appearance. Computer/1 Intellect 1 Chassis 70 5,000 Beta (2186) Smarter and more versatile, but suffering instability problems; humanlike, but obviously synthetic. Computer/2 Intellect 1 Chassis 70 10,000 Gamma (2190) More stable behaviour; human-like, but obviously synthetic. Computer/2 Intellect 1 Chassis 90 40,000 Delta (2200) Complex and flexible in approach, almost indistinguishable from humans. Computer/3 Intellect 2 Chassis 90 60,000 Epsilon(2214) Most complex to date, almost indistinguishable from humans. Also available also as a custom-build option.

Confined by the same electronic principles that hindered their electronic cousins they were little more than programmable machines in human form. It was not until startling developments in wetware science and accompanying biorobotics emerged in the mid-22nd century that the dream of a true android became a reality. Through bioengineering specific cell structures, programming individual neurons and artificially sequencing DNA strands, a biological element was introduced into the otherwise electromechanical construction of the first android body and then the brain. The result was more than an advanced CPU, it was a fully functional biocomputer a synthetic organism. Technically it was a cyborg, as it contained both organic and synthetic components these androids, released for sale in 2170, were an entirely new construct, the offspring of a whole new technology, all the way down to the cellular level. Transdyne Cybersystems led the research and development in this new field for decades and was quick to seize both legal a copyright and a manufacturing and marketing monopoly on the technology. All legally manufactured androids are Transdyne models without exception. Programming has steadily improved from the earliest Alpha models that could acknowledge and respond to a limited list of verbal commands only, to the fully interactive and emotive Gamma models of the 2190s. It was in 2209 however that the first sentient computer was brought online, not by Transdyne however but by rival. Four years later the rival company was forced into bankruptcy and all of their assets, research and the prototype AI became the property of TDC. The move was not swift enough to stop the appearance of a number of sentient computer core designs with various corporate labels (Leyland Okuda, for example) but it assured TDC was at the forefront of new AI development. In 2214 the new Epsilon-series was launched as the first truly sentient, synthetic life form. The Epsilon-series android was a not simply a self-aware computer, however. Several models of AI-CPU had earned that distinction first and were already performing services in a number of applications, from industry to research and even spacecraft mainframe monitoring and control. These fully responsive and intelligent machines were marvels in their own right but the unique nature and construction of the Transdyne androids took this technology to an amazing and truthfully unexpected apex. When coupled with the wetware convergence of machine and organic construction the android became more than aware, it was sentient, for all pretences, alive. What the bio-electronic brain lacked in conventional memory and processing, it expanded in ways even the technicians could not have anticipated. Each android began to develop, immediately upon activation, as an individual. Attempts to install the android consciousness into traditional computer roles proved disastrous, the subjects developing destabilizing neurosis or simply shutting down from the stress. When given the opportunity to perform as an individual however, they often exceeded their programming, achieving a level of sophistication that what not unlike the beginnings of personality. The Epsilon-series is now in its 7th model and has performed beyond all expectations. Androids have found : place not only as functional assistants but have demonstrated the ability to act independently, form relationships and enhance their initial programming. They remain somewhat restricted in the area of expressed emotion and it is still believed by most that what the android may express as preference, opinion, or creative thought is still just a matter of programmed behavioural algorithms. There is a movement by some however to grant androids status as living beings as with generations the distinction between artificial and actual life form becomes more blurred.","title":"Androids"},{"location":"Technology/Androids/#android-fabrication","text":"The modern android is human-like, electro-mechanical cyborg designed for harsh conditions or monotonous tasks (or both). Built around a sturdy carbon fiber skeleton is a complex system of silicon muscles that stabilizes and controls. An outer covering of bio-plastic sheeting is built up on top of a layer of flexible collagenous fibers. The most modern androids operate with a Model/4 computer running either a level 1, 2 or 3 Intellect program. To calculate an android's Intelligence in comparison to a human, add 5 to its Intellect program level (giving it a character Intelligence characteristic of 6-8). An android's social standing stands at a default level of 0. Power is provided for around three months by a 25 kW fuel cell requiring a liquid hydrogen fuel. Obviously, androids do not need to breath, drink or eat, but they do occasionally ingest a pale-coloured, semi-organic nutrient suspension in a siliconbased liquid medium; this serves as a lubricant for the system's micro-hydraulics. Some attempt to fit in' to their mission teams by eating and drinking at meal-times, these nutrients will pass through the system harmlessly until emptied by the android. Such an ability allows an android to blend in seamlessly, even covertly. The machinery, processor, fuel cell and carefully designed outer skin can be damaged, so it is prudent for androids to wear vacc suits or hostile environment suits. Vacuum, high pressure, high temperature and aggressive atmospheric chemical constituents can all irreparably damage an android. The cost of single unit precludes the avoidable and wasteful use of an android in such an environment. Most androids are competent and of average human intelligence. They are generally programmed with passive, non-aggressive personalities and are typically given the likeness of a mature (30-40 year-old) male or female. The aim is to blend in, to join in, to be team-player within a group of humans, supporting the leadership and providing useful options and advice without being forceful. Androids cannot harm humans and follow Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics. Fifth generation (Epsilon-series) androids can be bought as stock models for a competitive price, or the customer cn customize his android from parts available at the factory. This only applies to the most recent series of TDC androids. Custommade units are ready for delivery within 6-10 months. Buyers must specify their preferred options. Repair Station : Androids require an upright repair station, massing around 200 kg into which the android itself, steps. A transparent lid then closes, and the android plugs in, and undergoes a diagnostic and lubricant change; the fuel cell is topped up with if liquid hydrogen also, if needed. Typically, androids will require a check-up every month or sO, or after sustaining damage. Minor damage can usually be repaired in 1-6 hours.","title":"Android Fabrication"},{"location":"Technology/Androids/#next-generation-androids","text":"AI technology such as that found in androids is biological computer or wetware core processor which creates a volitional thinking machine, neural network with high level of cognition. For the incredible complexity of free thought, creativity, problem solving, and volitional action to work reliably and stably over time, it was found to work most efficiently in form which mirrored the neurological structure of the human brain. The Transdyne android brain is formed around artificially constructed neurons and electrode pairs. It uses electrical signals to read and write to the neurons, which are kept at a stable temperature and PH level, etc. A fully sapient android brain has billions of these artificial neurons, with numbers approximating that of a human brain. Lower levels of complexity can create sentience, even primitive reasoning, but fifth generation Transdyne androids (and perhaps others) possesses truly human-like levels of brain power.

This effect was limited, the field reaching only a or 4 meters and displaying a hard cap of 1.022157 standard Earth gravities. However, when confronted with counter gravitational or inertial energy the matrix repolarized, inverted the counter energy's potential and was able to, in effect, nullify this influence to a much higher 6G to 8G threshold. The dreams of gravimetric drives, tractor-beams and anti-gravity lifts were dashed, such marvels relegated to future projects perhaps after years of research but the Faraday Emitter in its current state proved perfect for two critical applications.

Hard Copy : A misnomer that has come to describe any form of dataholding object from a data-disk to a sheet of paper. The use of courier services to manually deliver such information is still popular, accompanying parcel delivery as a safe, albeit slow, alternative to other means of transfer. Fibre Optics : A direct hard-wired connection between communication devices is still the most prevalent method of distant communication on any world or vessel. Reliable and secure, a 'land line' avoids many of the pitfalls of wireless communications and is by far the more cost effective solution. Networks of fibre optics web every habitable zone and are capable of transferring massive amounts of data as well as video and audio communiques. Radio : Electromagnetic transfer of information is still a favourite form of communication in the universe. Improvements to bandwidth, wavelength stability and transmitting power have kept this technology current, although larger equipment packages have become necessary to manage it. Despite the advances in signal strength, now capable of interplanetary distances, the radio wave is still limited by light speed and steadily degrading efficiency over distance. It remains however the preferred medium to broadcast audio and video as well as attached data bursts. Microwave based communications are still utilized but typically for secure, short-range transmissions only. They are particularly common in ground to orbit or inter-orbital comms. Maser sets are common equipment in any comm suite. Tight Beam Laser :Using lasers to carry information to a specific target is a highly secure and efficient, if expensive, medium. Capable of tremendous distance and pin point accuracy Free Space Optical Communication (FSOC) has been in use for century or more but has come into its own. Powerful carrier frequencies 'piggy backed' on laser emissions can deliver data packs and large memory caches at incredible speeds. A series of laser-linked satellites make the Integrated Data Network within well-travelled space possible. Hyperwave Transceivers : Faster-than-light communication exists, although it certainly is not instantaneous. All starships equipped with hyperdrive have FTL communication capability by default, as do most large outposts and colony worlds. The system requires a space-based hyperwave satellite to relay the signal from one star system to another it cannot be done from a planetary or moon surface. Typically an uplink tower sends the message up to the hyperwave satellite which then powers up to send it on its journey through hyperspace. As would be expected, these satellite relays are incredibly expensive and only the larger colony worlds with populations in the millions can afford to maintain more than one of them. Communication on the Network takes 1 parsec per day. Hyperwave bandwidth is small, allowing only a short burst of text (200 characters maximum; without spaces), much like an ancient telegram. Private use is very costly, the Network will charge you, your company or your colony administrator $50 per character (spaces are not charged). A 200 character message costs $10,000! Utilizing hyperdrive methodology a hyperwave transceiver opens a minute nanosingularity hyperspace shunt and a transmits a isomodulated, narrow beam LnK2 (Link) laser through the tunnel. Similar to hyperspace navigation the carrier beam is configured to respond to hyper resonant ripple effects, speeding towards the plotted destination and breaching there, normally in proximity to another subspace satellite receiver. The message is then forwarded by conventional means on through whatever network is available. Hyperwave satellites are extremely expensive and maintenance intensive and only the most profitable or established locations can hope to be assigned on. The equipment is truly huge in scale with the In typical orbital transceiver weighing in at several tons and the dish measuring several dozen meters in diameter. These satellites are truly immense apparatus and require equally extensive support equipment. FTL capable vessels however are already equipped with the lion's share of the process and typically have a hyperwave transceiver as part of their communications suite. This module is linked to their hyperdrive and can facilitate FTL transmissions at a fraction of the energy cost and electronic complexity of a standalone unit. The relay system of the Network is operated by the United Corporate Combine and is more formally known as the Integrated Data Network. It is headquartered on the Earth's Moon. The Network operates a small a fleet of platform support vessels that it uses to deploy new satellites, repair or decommission old ones and to ferry personnel from site to site. The organization is also tasked with scanning local star systems for communications, and is particularly concerned with distress signals from both civilian and military starships. Starship Communications Standard comm suites on spacecraft, orbital platforms and both space-based and planetary installations allow for radio and free-space optical laser communications system wide. Radio transmitters are capable of narrow and broadband transmissions while laser communication rigs require precise target location data to connect. Trafficked systems incorporate FSOC linked satellite networks to facilitate regular comms while almost any orbital body of corporate or governmental interest is seeded with a few communication satellites. Commercial com gear permits operations on a number of approved frequencies and emergency bands while restricted frequencies are utilized by military and private entities. All such comm traffic is of course at light-speed only with the associated delays at interplanetary distances. Videophones In the HOSTILE setting, the revolution in communications wasn't the cellphone, but the videophone. There are videophones in cars, on office desks, in bars and clubs, railway stations and airports, space stations, starship corridors and apartments. And of course they exist in public phone booths, too. But don't think that these phones are all simply dial-and-talk interfaces, most can also accept data cards. Some of these are business cards that, when slotted into the phone, ring the employee at the business automatically. The Retro-Radio Instrumentation is typical of the technology of the time. Cathode screens, manual key boards, toggles, rotary knobs, dials and switches are prominent with hand held receivers, microphones and wall mounted intercom panels the norm. Readouts are backlit indicators and needle deflection gauges. Hard copy printers are common place, providing printed format message translation or performance analysis. Quality of audio or visual communications is highly dependent on signal strength but in general is moderate to poor, with the quality of the receiving display equipment potentially degrading quality further. This is especially true in space applications. Transmission of teletype hard copy written messages is an ongoing and popular alternative as signal strength requirements are minimal and even outdated equipment reliable that mode.","title":"Communication"},{"location":"Technology/Communication/#communication","text":"There are five primary means of communications in use in the 23rd century.

Key differences are a lack of wi-fi cable-less technology and the absence of ultra-miniaturization of computing. There are no palm computers or smart phones and touch screen technology does not exist (apart from the advances made in the Hosaka Memex, see later). None of this means to say the computers in 2225 are not powerful and versatile machines, it's just that they have a number of minor limitations which we in the twenty-teens, are no longer familiar with. Forget full-colour LCD or plasma screens, too, the cathode-ray tube (CRT) monitors in HOSTILE are monochrome, typically green, although amber, blue and even white displays are in use (the actual colour depends on the type of phosphor being used to create the display. The computers of the 22nd and early 23rd century certainly are wonders of technology, the culmination of decades of improvements in processing speed, data storage and in recent years, user interface and artificial intelligence. They are however bound mechanically by the electronic construction methods of the society they serve and in this regard computers have become faster, smarter and more intuitive but also larger, and more demanding of power and cooling. Even computerized sub-systems, control modules and monitoring equipment, along with a million other subtle applications in modern technology, must contend with the restrictions of their component parts. Chief among these is size. For all their sophistication and capability the computers of 2225 AD are solid, bulky and for the most part ugly. These are incredibly powerful machines but equally power hungry, frail, maintenance demanding and super-heated. Mainframes Mainframes, the true work horses of the computer world, are large with spacecraft and naval shipping models requiring entire sections of the ship to commit to several tons of memory storage and processing equipment. Permanent ground installations in office blocks and corporate HQs can be even bigger with CPU speed and capability limited only by sheer acreage, power supply and coolant. Main frames are sealed behind ventilated metal shielding and sprout kilometres of electrical conduit, fiber optic cable and coolant lines. Temperatures must be continually controlled to keep CPUS at peak performance and mainframe berths are kept extremely cold, as a rule. Backup generators, redundant coolant equipment, fire suppression and other support machinery surround mainframes increasing their bulk and complexity. The tonnage assigned to the starship's bridge typically incorporates both avionics and much of this extensive computing infrastructure. Workstations Hard-wired workstations are the user portals into the computer brain of the mainframe. They are used to provide outputs from the mainframe and to allow access to its capabilities. Workstations are often used in factories, on colonies and on board starships and space-stations. Used to access i mainframe, the workstation has a rating of Model/0 (it does not run its own programs). Workstations, however, can also be stand-alone computers, much like modern-day PCs. They have integral processors and memory hard drives with their own dedicated software. Workstations in some installations or businesses will often be connected to one another via d wired network and can be rated as a Model/1 to a Model/4. A workstation weighs around 10kg (without chair and console unit) and costs $250. Construction of a 'computer room' is de rigeur when a mainframe iS installed, in a building, starship or colony complex. This 6 metre-square room houses a master workstation which allows an operator to see every active monitor on the computer network, it allows deep-level programming to be carried out and must be used in those cases where the administration password is required. Typically the room requires a coded a pass to enter, either via an ID card slotted into a reader or a numeric keypad. Portable Terminals Portable computers are available but provide a minimum of processing power and memory and weigh in at around 5kg. These stand-alone computers resemble modern laptops with hinged cases and they often run dedicated software; however they must be connected to the hardware they control via a cable. Controls for complex field equipment require these dedicated laptops, often supplied in tough, anti-shock cases with integral carry handles. Portable terminals like this are supplied along with remote sentry guns, uplink transmitters, portable radars and drones (amongst other things). Portable terminals weigh 5 kg and are rated from Model/1 to Model/4. Interfacing Computer screens are monochromatic cathode screens for the most part, simplistic and purely functional in design with little thought to user appeal. Keyboards are the primary control interface for users, spring-loaded keys clacking loudly when entering data or command prompts. Some expert-system keyboards feature integral trackballs for the precise targeting or activation of commands or for interfacing with graphical displays. Voice recognition modules are available of course but are rarely utilized at workstations or remote terminals. Only direct communication with the central CPU typically warrants such a luxury and then only on top-of-the-line models. Peripherals such as memory storage disk drives and printers are common, with hardcopy printouts of critical data lines regular procedure for many users. The Data Network Working in an orbital hab, an outpost or in the science bay of starship, a character will have access to a Local Area Network (LAN) which constantly monitors machinery, environmental readings and subsystems using telemetry things like ATVs, vacc suits and drones all in real time. Of course the LAN also features extensive memory files and scientific software, but it is mainly concerned with monitoring and controlling a complex piece of machinery. Some corporations and other organisations run their own LANs known as intranets, closed systems that allow access to wider nets only through established data gateways. A data network exists in 2225 that not only covers the entire Earth, but stations throughout the Solar System and all of the Off-World Colonies and outposts as far as the Outer Rim. It exists where communication exists, data piggy-backing on comlines to allow computers to transfer data and to communicate with one another. Today we call this the Internet, in HOSTILE it is known as the Integrated Data Network (IDN, or simply, 'Network'). Because communication is greatly delayed by the great interplanetary and interstellar distances involved, the Network employs a new set of protocols and technologies that are tolerant to large delays and errors. Data requiring transfer is bundled, stored and then forwarded and this means that instantaneous net usage is impossible. The Network across the Solar System is broken up into separate Planetary Area Networks (PANs), such as Earth-Net, TitanNet and so on. Likewise, the separate interstellar colony and outpost worlds have their own PANs (such as Hiroshima-Net). The huge communication time lag between worlds effectively closes these PANs off from one another and communication between them is effectively via text, voice or video email, forwarded data transfer packets and bulletins. Data Storage Data Cards are the main method of mobile information storage and resemble modern-day smart cards. A data card resembles a credit card in size and shape but it iS more than a piece of plastic. The inside of a data card contains an embedded microprocessor. Data cards may have up to 1 gigabyte of RAM as well as a 16-bit microprocessor; they use a serial interface and receive their power from the card reader they are currently connected to. Their weight is negligible and their cost is $5 each. Optical Discs are used as a more powerful file storage platform and are also the central format for playing media (video and audio). The standard Baumann GmbH MiniDisk series holds up to 15.9 gigabytes of data and each glass disc is permanently mounted within a small, rectangular plastic case. The disc itself can withstand extreme temperatures and pressures and is predicted to hold its data internally for millennia. Their weight is negligible and their cost is $15 each. Personal Electronics There are a variety of small, personal electronics, but nothing comes close to the modern smart phone or tablet. There are digital cameras, as well as card readers and optical disc readers, for example, which are used for reading or editing data cards or watching videos, respectively. Beyond the portable terminal (the HOSTILE equivalent of the laptop) sits the memex, a single-use electronic data handling clipboard. Hosaka 4 Memex E-Board : A handy, clipboard-sized Model/0 terminal running administration and record-keeping software. It features a monochromatic screen with an in-built stylus.

It can plug into the Network physically and in a world like HOSTILE where wireless computing does not exist, the memex may play a much bigger role. Cops can use it to check in to HQ to search through mugshots or licence plates, small amounts of data can be downloaded by cable into the memex memory. Data cards are used to add more data to the functionality of the memex, and any accounts or records that the device creates can be stored on data card. Starship crews, courier firms and corporations around the world use the memex to record, track and confirm cargos and packages.

There are no palm computers or smart phones and touch screen technology does not exist (apart from the advances made in the Hosaka Memex, see later). None of this means to say the computers in 2225 are not powerful and versatile machines, it's just that they have a number of minor limitations which we in the twenty-teens, are no longer familiar with.

They are however bound mechanically by the electronic construction methods of the society they serve and in this regard computers have become faster, smarter and more intuitive but also larger, and more demanding of power and cooling. Even computerized sub-systems, control modules and monitoring equipment, along with a million other subtle applications in modern technology, must contend with the restrictions of their component parts.

A hyperdrive does not have a maximum range instead, the ship's drive rating (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6) indicates the number of parsecs crossed per week of travel. Speeds are rated at 'parsecs per week'. Hyperdrives do not consume additional fuel, but use electrical power, therefore the ship's powerplant must equal or exceed the rating of the hyperdrive. A starship can remain in hyperspace until either its coolant or its life support needs replenishing. Discovery & Exploration Faster than light travel is made possible by the discovery of a pseudo-dimension, one apparently co-existing with our own but possessing natural laws that are vastly different and for the most part void of scientific understanding. This altered reality was given several designations in the laboratory but is widely known simply as hyperspace, as plane of existence separate and yet coinciding with the natural universe. The discovery was the culmination of decades of research based on the original postulates established by Burkard Heim, who coined the phrase 'hyperspace' in the mid 20th century, as one of several additional dimensions, above and apart from the physical three and Einstein's fourth. Heim's Unified Quantum Field Principles On Electro-Gravitational Energy Conversion and later the work of Walter Droscher and his colleague Jochem Hauser would lead to a century of study and ongoing scientific experimentation. The eventual result was two major breakthroughs assisting mankind's exploration of space; artificial gravity and the hyperdrive. The first 'hyperspace' breech was generated by Yana Shuli Hurtz, a professor at the Technion Institute in Haifa, Israel in 2103 during experiments directed at developing a method for the generation of artificial gravity. The initially unstable and potentially dangerous Paragravity Dynamo utilised a massive amount of electromagnetic radiation generated a from the spinning of a superconductor and temporarily stored within kilometres of superconducting coils. This energy was directed through contrabaric emitters to create a massive gravitomagnetic field initially in the 60-85 Tesla range. The field, although failing to produce the intended artificial-gravity results, instead propagated the first inter-dimensional breech. The effect was transient, with the unstable breech or shunt' collapsing immediately when interrupted by the presence of the Earth's own gravitational field but the implications were astounding. For 0.06 seconds the dynamo and its support structures had not produced gravity, they had ceased to exist. Where they had gone was a mystery but it spurred it an entirely new branch of scientific research, one that would dwarf the eventual benefits of artificial gravity. Three years later (2106), at the Helstrom Research Laboratory on the asteroid Hygeia, working prototype of a hyperdrive was constructed, the experimental navigational equipment brought online and a series of performance tests begun. The first passengers to visit hyperspace were instrument packages and scientific apparatus, carried within the hull of the Red Shift III test vehicle as it engaged in a series of increasingly distant hyperspace 'jumps'. As the vessel was 'shunted' into the hyperspace breech it encountered a quantum tunnel effect which extended from the departure jump point to the preprogrammed arrival point somewhere ahead. Without a designated beginning and end to this hyper-dimensional conduit the breach simply closed after a few seconds, the tremendous electromagnetic radiation dissipating into space. When correctly configured however the tunnel not only enveloped the vessel but exposed it to a torrent of accelerated hyper-resonant 'ripples' in the tunnel's activity stream. These ripples propelled the vessel forward, through the tunnel, at an incredible yet non-Newtonian velocity. The vessel itself experienced no sign of this velocity, no sense of movement at all and its conventional engines lay dormant throughout, a natural acceleration driving her through hyperspace as a ship caught a in a strong current. The speed of this passage was dependent both on the mass of the vessel and the power of the 'shunt' generated as these factors correlated directly to the velocity induced by the resonant ripple effect. Red Shift VII would have the distinction of successfully carrying the first human into and through hyperspace on June 28, 2106. The jump was only 135 million kilometers but the Red Shift (Christened 'Snark') arrived at the designated arrival point in only 6.4 minutes. Effects of Hyperspace Snark's astounding feat marked man's freedom from the confines of his system of birth and the start of his race to the stars. Less advertised, however, was the condition of the flight's test pilot, US Navy Captain Michael Squires. Animal test subjects had been utilized in previous tests and they'd returned with alarming behavioural disorders. The physicians believed these side effects could be overcome by a human being's understanding of the bizarre experience and that they were for the most part the result of the subject's stress. They proved to be wrong however and eleven human pilots suffered horrendous mental and emotional disorders after their exposure before researchers proclaimed hyperspace unfit for conscious passengers. When subjected to the hyperspace environment while in cryosleep or it 'hypersleep' as it came to be called, travellers were unaffected by the neurosis and occasional coma-like symptoms experienced by the early test pilots. It became common protocol, therefore, to put passengers and crew into hypersleep and to assign monitoring duties on hyperspace voyages to the ship's computer or (on military craft) to an android. Hyperspace itself appears as a vast, starless, and foreboding blackness, whatever light sources exist appear blue, shifting into invisible ultraviolet, except for directly in front and behind where the background microwave radiation in the path of the approaching ship blue shifts to the front and red shifts behind, providing a glowing, intensifying azure or magenta visual reference to the tunnelling phenomena at work. Plotting a hyperspace run into the unknown, no matter how exacting the preliminary astronomical data, is incredibly dangerous and costly. Faster-Than-Light probes are sent out first to explore and map and then return with the data with which future hyperspace co-ordinates are plotted. These have to be very short trips however, the probes only jumping a fragment of a light year each time. Together with the analysis required it to establish jump coordinates, it takes many months to establish even a single light year hyperspace run to a new location. Because of this, all crews in known space are using established routes and the nav-routes they work on to prepare their journey are more or less modifications of the program for current celestial movements, etc. Navigators are basically updating the pre-plotted hyperspace routes with 'at the moment' specifics. Within the ship the drain on even the most overpowered reactors is sufficient to leech power from most onboard systems so lights are dim, many tertiary systems and crew luxuries inoperable and the temperature uncomfortably cold, some inherent element of hyperspace leeching the heat even from a wide open reactor. When the hyperspace shunt opens a region of space roughly equal to the dimensions of the vessel, visually it blurs slightly then begins to glow blue from the localized light beginning to accelerate therein. A minute spark of flashing energy forms at the region's centre then expands in a vortex like pattern for a little over 2 seconds before dissipating in a sudden flash. When the light fades the vessel is gone. The reverse is true when an FTL vessel emerges only the ship's appearance is announced by a red-shift of approaching hyperspeed light and subsequent flash instead. Hyperdrive Operating Parameters Apparent Velocity : A hyperdrive does not have a maximum range instead, the ship's drive rating (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6) indicates the number of parsecs crossed per week of travel. Speeds are rated at 'parsecs per week'. A drive rated '1' will take 7 weeks to get to a destination 7 parsecs away. Fuel: Hyperdrives do not consume additional fuel, but use electrical power supplied by the ship's fusion reactor. Therefore ship's powerplant must equal or exceed the rating of the hyperdrive. Endurance : A drive can maintain its presence within the hyperspace tunnel indefinitely, it is limited only by the amount of coolant carried on board and the life support needs of the crew. Typically enough coolant is carried for 12 months of reactor operation, equal in displacement to the fusion reactor itself. Entering Hyperspace : Gravity and hyperspace have a very uneasy relationship, and entering hyperspace iS best done away from any major gravitational field (such as the system's star). Pre-existing hyperspace points (HSPs) have been charted in all explored star systems, all of which exist well beyond a star's habitable zone. The bigger the star the more luminous the star is) the further out these HSPs are. Hyperspace points are surveyed locations beyond a star's habitable zone, they are the perfect confluence ( gravity, dark matter, orbital mechanics and fluctuations through time that allow easy access to hyperspace. There are scores of HSPs in any one star system, each one is an invisible 'bubble' of 'hyperweak' space in the outer is system that is several thousands of kilometres in diameter. Leaving Hyperspace : Due to the serious risk of emerging within or adjacent to a large moon or planet, hyperspace jumps are by necessity terminated at pre-mapped, pre-surveyed hyperspace points within the destination star system. Starships emerge with the same velocity with which they entered hyperspace and on a preferred pre-planned course to the system's mainworld. It must decelerate to enter orbit around that world. Communications Within Hyperspace : FTL communications (both sending and receiving) using a hyperwave transceiver is possible both while the ship iS in hyperspace and when it is in 'real space'. Messages are brief (see next chapter, Communication). Sensor Operations : There are no sensors currently suitable for use in hyperspace. Distance travelled iS measured purely by reference to elapsed time and hyperdrive-calibrated frequency. Medical Effects of Hyperspace Exposure : Humans feel uncomfortable (see main text) if awake during hyperspace transit. In addition, roll 3+ on 2D6 each week to avoid a serious indefinite symptom (increase difficulty by +1, each week after that). The 6 most serious symptoms include amnesia, stupefaction, violent paranoia, tremors & fits, self-harm, terrifying hallucinations.","title":"Hyperdrive"},{"location":"Technology/Hyperdrive/#hyperdrive","text":"Starships in the HOSTILE setting use type of hyperdrive.

To that end targeted temperature management (TTM), or 'therapeutic hypothermia' was put into practice specifically for interstellar travel. TTM reduces a patient's core body temperature, cooling vital organs and slowing metabolic rates similar to those of hibernating mammals, such as the arctic ground squirrel. This space-faring technology is called statis or hypersleep, but is also known (erroneously) as cryogenic freezing or 'cryo'. This hibernation mimics the natural hibernation of bears and squirrels in the wintertime when food is scarce. Crew-members in stasis sleep and breathe very slowly, whilst food is administered by an intravenous pump. The and crewman still ages, albeit at a slightly a slower rate. Hypersleep Pods Hypersleep stasis pods (or 'tubes') must be included for every human being onboard I hyperdrive-equipped starship; epilepsy, madness, insanity or coma will affect any living creature passing through hyperspace that is not protected by stasis. One hypersleep pod carries one crewman or passenger, costs $50,000, and displaces one-half ton. The pods are typically laid out in rows a within a dedicated stasis or hypersleep chamber. The walls of the chamber house lockers for clothing and personal items, and the berth typically includes a toilet and shower for last minute ablutions. The hypersleep chamber is made up a of a contoured bed with heatable pads, fitted within an enclosed capsule. These have transparent and fireproof lids.

Zero-loss lithium ion batteries within a backup system support the chamber's function for up to 100 years in case of emergency. While individuals in status are removed from the effects of timeand incurable insanity, long periods of hypersleep can cause muscle tone to weaken, often leading to cramps and the diminishing of physical abilities upon waking. Even sO, stasis tubes are effective to the point of being able to sustain and suspend an individual for decades, although waking from such a lengthy period of stasis carries with it minor side effects, including nausea, exhaustion and dizziness, that may last for several days. Being removed from stasis abruptly without a proper wake-up procedure is dangerous, and while not usually fatal, it can lead to damage. Stasis Systems Passengers or crewmen entering stasis are actively cooled to a mild hypothermic state (defined as a core temperature between 32 to 34 \u00b0C). Shivering (a muscle activation response that tries to rewarm the body) is commonly suppressed with very low-level infusion of propofol and fentanyl, with the intermittent treatment of benzodiazepine. The ship's medic typically administers this first shot, whilst carrying out quick medical check to ascertain the suitability of the subject for stasis. He or she then helps the subject get settled in the chamber and inserts both a feeding drip, a urine catheter and the all-important cooling line. In most cases this cooling catheter would be inserted into the crew's femoral vein or into the chest. A double lumen, cooled saline solution is then is pumped a through a metal coated cooling line inserted into the subject's femoral vein. The saline cools a crewman's whole body by lowering the temperature of their blood through conduction cooling. No cooled fluid actually enters the patient's blood stream. The Haruna K560 Cool-Line is the most is common version of the stasis cooling system in use today. All of the nutrition and hydration requirements of a crewman are provided by liquid solution that is administered via an intravenous (IV) feeding drip directly into the body. This aqueous solution contains all nutrients that the body needs to maintain full physiologic function and is fed slowly through the IV. Once the ship's computer (or the android on-board) drops the ship out of hyperspace, it will initiate the crew wakeup procedure, pumping warm water into the veinal lines, and shutting off the feeding lines. It will also activate heating pads inside the seat cushion. Passenger Ticketing Options Standard-Class Starship Ticket ($1,000) This is a ticket on a commercial liner. With standard-class ticket the passenger is frozen at the starport and shipped to the starship like freight. He or she has a meagre 10kg baggage allowance that fits into the locker at the foot of the hypersleep pod. Elite-Class Starship Ticket ($8,000) This is also ticket on commercial liner. The elite-class ticket has more perks, however, reflecting its higher price tag. Passengers are given a drink and snack before being put into hypersleep on board ship, and they are woken on approach to their destination, giving them time to shower, dress, eat and acclimatize themselves to 'normal space' before deboarding the starship. In short, they are treated more like privileged crew than freight. Elite-class tickets include : generous 1000 kg baggage allowance that is carried in the ship's hold. A 10 kg 'carry-on bag' is also allowed that is stowed into the locker at the foot of the hypersleep pod.","title":"Hypersleep"},{"location":"Technology/Hypersleep/#hypersleep","text":"As already discussed in the Hyperdrive chapter, human beings have struggled and failed to retain their sanity whilst travelling through hyperspace.

This space-faring technology is called statis or hypersleep, but is also known (erroneously) as cryogenic freezing or 'cryo'.

Foremost for the populations of Earth and for those of the larger core colonies, fusion powerplants are utilised. The first fusion reactor began supplying electricity to customers in 2060. Origins of Fusion Back in the 21St century, a Earth found a way to shake-off its dependence on Luna solar power energy when the first fusion reactor came online in 2060. The 'miracle powerplant', fusion reactors produced very little radioactive waste but incredible amounts of power. Various fuels are needed, such as deuterium and tritium, but the most sought after was helium-3. Although small amounts can be gathered on Earth, the greatest concentrations were in the solar system, waiting to be collected. This helium-3 was blasted into rocky surfaces by the solar wind and found on Mercury, the Moon and on the gas giants in the outer solar system. Earth had to secure a source of He-3 and it set its sights on Mercury, sending an initial colony to the Sobkau region in 2067. It wasn't to be. Expensive operations were sponsored that began to mine helium-3 from the Sobkou basin, but where was it all? To the shock of all concerned, it seemed that Mercury had very little of the precious material. It was now the dash for Saturn, and the vast amounts of helium-3 there, that quickly turned the Sobkou debacle into a forgotten memory. The great expansion into the outer solar system began apace in the early 2070s. New rockets, nuclear thermal drives that were based around a fission gas-cored reactor using liquid hydrogen or water as a reaction mass, powered those long range missions. Fusion powerplants at that time were far too large to scale down enough for use as a space drive and so fission reactors remained the powerplant that allowed the exploration of the solar system. It was in 2084 that explorers from Earth arrived at Saturn with everything they needed to begin mining helium-3 from the gas giant's rich atmosphere. It established bases on the twin planetoids of Janus and Epimetheus; and there began a fusion industry that has continued into the present day. Helium-3 is extracted from Off-World colonies and shipped to Earth on multi-megaton starships to feed Earth's fusion reactors. The Tokamak Reactor Helium-3 is a stable isotope of helium that is missing a neutron, with this missing neutron allowing for the production of clean energy. Two types of fusion reactions make use of Helium-3 to produce clean energy. The first uses deuterium (deuterium S a hydrogen with a neutron) reacting with Helium-3, to produce helium and a proton. The second type of reactions uses two atoms of helium-3 to create helium and two protons. The protons created during this last reaction are the crown jewel of Heliumfusion. One of the best parts of the Helium-3 reaction is the complete lack of radioactive by-products. No neutrons are emitted and no isotopes are left as products that could radioactively decay. The proton is a particularly nice side product, since clean energy can be harnessed from this stray proton by manipulating within in an electrostatic field. Traditional nuclear fission reactions used to create heat, which was then used to heat water. The boiling water forced turbines to spin and generate energy. In the helium-3 fusion process, energy iS created via the reaction itself, with no nasty radioactive material for future generations to monitor. While industrial-grade super-conducting magnets arranged as toroid (a 'tokomak') suspend the fuel and hold it in place, the reactor uses a process called radiofrequency heating to ignite the nuclear fuel. Antennas outside the tokamak use a specific frequency of radio waves to excite the particles. The radio waves are specifically calibrated to target the helium-3 ions. Because the helium-3 accounts for only fraction of the fuel's total density, focusing the radio-frequency heating on the minority ions allows them to reach extreme energy levels. The excited ions then slam into the reactor's outer shell, generating heat and electricity. In order to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the nuclei, they must have a temperature of several tens of millions of degrees, under which conditions they no longer form neutral atoms but exist in the plasma state. At these temperatures, no material container could withstand the extreme heat of the plasma. HOSTILE fusion tokamaks utilise magnetic confinement to create these conditions. They use the electrical conductivity of the plasma to contain it with powerful magnetic fields in the form of a hot plasma in the shape of spinning torus. Meanwhile the tokamak's superconducting magnets and support structure must be chilled close to absolute zero and so most reactor's require steady supply of liquid hydrogen as a coolant. Tokamaks are the workhorses of fusion solid, symmetrical, and relatively straightforward to engineer. Space-Based Reactors Whilst large-scale, planet-bound reactors utilise helium-3 as their reaction fuel, space-based and starship reactors may use deuterium, tritium or helium-3, expanding their fuel choices when isolated from abundant fuel sources. The fusion powerplants still require small amounts of liquid hydrogen as a coolant to function efficiently. The standard rules for powerplants in Cepheus Engine are used. A starship powerplant rating must be equal or higher to either the hyperdrive or half the ship's maneuver drive. Although it has no effect on game-play and serves only as set-dressing, starship powerplant ratings can be thought of as being equivalent to Giga Watts of power output; meaning that a Powerplant 4 starship produces 4 GW. Micro-Fusion Plants Extremely small fusion reactors are in production, suitable as mining power sources or the powerplants for shuttles and small craft. None have been licensed for use within air or ground vehicles due to the dangers of radiation following an accident. The larger marine ships do, however, utilise fusion power. As setting detail, we can assume that each micro-fusion powerplant rating is equivalent to 10 Mega Watts of power. A shuttle with a level 3 powerplant then, has a 30 a MW rating. The microfusion plant is not simply a scaled down tokomak, that would be an impossibility due CO size and weight considerations. Instead of confining the plasma within a doughnut-shaped ring, a series of superconducting coils generates a magnetic-field in which plasma is held within the broader confines of the entire cylindrical reaction chamber. Superconducting magnets within coils generate a magnetic field around the outer border of the chamber. The system is therefore regulated by self-tuning feedback mechanism, whereby the farther out the plasma goes, the stronger the magnetic field pushes back to contain it. Micro-Fusion plants currently range in size from 1.2 to 10.5 tons of displacement (6,000 52,500 kg). Fuel Cells Petroleum is abundant, shipped to Earth via huge space-faring oil tankers, but much of this oil supplies the plastics industry. On Earth and in the OffWorld colonies, too, hydrogen fuel cells are the dominant form of vehicular power generation. Where oxygen exists within an atmosphere, then some colonial societies operate gas turbine vehicles, such as rovers, tractors, container lifters and trucks. Gas turbines require a petrochemical fuel, and kg. for kg. this still provides more power than an equivalent-sized fuel cell. Virtually all medium to large aircraft are also powered by gas turbine jet engines. The US military had relied on a gas turbine or petroleumdriven vehicle fleet until the 2120s, but deployments to the newly established OffWorld colonies soon highlighted a glaring shortcoming gas turbines are airbreathing engines, useless on vacuum worlds, or planets with poisonous and alien atmospheres. Within the next ten years, much of the US military switched to closed fuel cell vehicle powerplants that do not require sources of external oxygen the vehicles carry liquid oxygen tanks with them to supply the required oxidizer. A fuel cell S an electrochemical cell that converts the chemical energy from a fuel into electricity through an electrochemical reaction of hydrogen fuel with oxygen or another oxidizing agent. Fuel cells are different from batteries in requiring a continuous source of fuel and oxygen (usually from air) to sustain the chemical reaction, whereas a in a battery the chemical energy comes from chemicals already present in the battery. Fuel cells can produce electricity continuously for as long as fuel and oxygen are supplied. There are many types of fuel cells, but they all consist of an anode, a cathode, and an electrolyte that allows positively charged hydrogen ions (protons) to move between the two sides of the fuel cell. At the anode a catalyst causes the fuel to undergo oxidation reactions that generate protons (positively charged hydrogen ions) and electrons. The protons flow from the anode to the cathode through the electrolyte after the reaction. At the same time, electrons are drawn from the anode to the cathode through an external circuit, producing direct current electricity. At the cathode, another catalyst causes hydrogen ions, electrons, and oxygen to react, forming water. Fuel cells are classified by the type of electrolyte they use and by the difference in startup time ranging from 1 second for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEM fuel cells, or PEMFC) to 10 minutes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC). Magnetohydrodynamic Generators A magnetohydrodynamic generator (MHD generator) is a magnetohydrodynamic converter that transforms thermal energy and kinetic energy into electricity. MHD generators are different from traditional electric generators in that they operate at high temperatures without moving parts. MHD power plants create a plasma a by burning liquid hydrogen and oxygen, pushing the resulting plasma into the turbine where it creates electricity just like a regular generator, except that the plasma takes the place of the spinning coils in the regular generator. The fuel needs to ignite the fuel, to start the process, just as a spark is needed to start an internal combustion engine thereafter the turbine will produce net power. The working fluid in a closed cycle MHD is circulated in a closed loop. Hence, in this case inert gas or liquid metal is used as the working fluid to transfer the heat. The liquid metal has typically the advantage of high electrical conductivity, hence the heat provided by the combustion material need not be too high. Contrary to the open loop system there is no inlet and outlet for the atmospheric air. Hence, the process is simplified to great extent, as the same fluid is circulated time and again for effective heat transfer. Magnetohydrodynamic powerplants are becoming more popular as sources of power for large machinery, such as ships, hovercraft, trains, oversized trucks, submarines and tanks etc. Currently, PEM fuel cells are struggling to supply the energy required by these power hungry pieces of machinery. MHD powerplants are poised to fill that huge gap between fuel cell and micro-fusion.","title":"Power"},{"location":"Technology/Power/#power","text":"The power requirements of humans on Earth, in space and on the Off-World colonies is huge, and provided by a variety of technologies.
