<p>United States Marines Corps</p>
<p><em>Before God, I swear this creed. My rifle and I are the defenders of my country. We are the masters of our enemy. We are the saviours of my life. So be it, until victory is America's and there is no enemy but peace.</em></p>
<p>From The Creed of the United States Marine</p>
<p>The United States Marine Corps (USMC) is America's premier quick reaction force, capable of being deployed at short notice via land, sea, air and space. The USMC put troops on board the first US Space Command (USSC) space stations in the 2020s, Marines travelled to Mars in 2027 and helped build Camp Deerman at Reunion in 2028. For deployments into space, the Marine Corps works closely with the United States Space Command (see below). It is now standard for Marines to receive training in space operations and part of that training is the High-Intensity Survival Training (HIST), usually carried out on the Moon or on Mars. </p>
<p>Following basic training, a Marine is usually assigned to one of three active Marine ground divisions: the 1st Marine Division (Camp Pendleton, CA.), 2nd Marine Division (Camp Lejeune, NC.) and the 3rd Marine Division (Twentynine Palms Base, CA). Marines in combat are supported by air and spacecraft, and these elements are organized as three Marine aerospace wings: 1st Marine Aerospace Wing, 2nd Marine Aerospace Wing and the 35th Marine Aerospace Wing. The Corps also maintains three logistical units that supply vehicles, catering, supplies and maintenance. Unsurprisingly, they are named the 1st Marine Logistics Group, the 2nd Marine Logistics Group and the 3rd Logistics Group. This all seems straightforward, however, these divisions and wings and the units that they are divided up into, are rarely committed to battle wholesale.</p>
<p>Instead, three permanent task forces are in existence that take Marine units from those divisions and aerospace wings on a long-term basis, and these Marine Expeditionary Forces (MEFs) stand ready to fight major armed conflicts for the USA and its Community of American State allies. II Marine Expeditionary Force, for example, is currently composed of the 2nd Marine Division, the 2nd Marine Aerospace, Wing and the 2nd Marine Logistics Group. II MEF also includes a command group and three smaller composite units called Marine Expeditionary Units (MEU's); the 22nd MEU, the 24th MEU and the 26th MEU.</p>
<h2 id="the-marine-expeditionary-unit">The Marine Expeditionary Unit</h2>
<p>When not engaged in major wars (such as on Tau Ceti at the moment), the bulk of Marine work is conducted by these smaller, easily transportable Marine Expeditionary Units. Each one is composed of a reinforced Battalion Landing Team, a reinforced aerospace squadron, a combat logistics battalion and company-sized headquarters element. All of the units are pulled from the parent Marine Expeditionary Force and in total, the MEU'S manpower stands at around 2,200. It is usually commanded by a Marine colonel. Units that make up an active MEU spend a year deployed onboard US Space Command starships, this is followed by three months leave on Earth, followed by six months of training. While the MEU has its downtime, another MEU is deployed in its place.</p>
<p>An MEU has everything it needs to fight without short-term resupply or reinforcement: infantry, armoured vehicles, artillery, recon assets, headquarters and communications, supply, engineering, maintenance, medical support, catering and aerospace support and drop capability. It is an 'army-on-the-move', deployed not at a Marine base, but at a US Space Command base where it can rapidly board assault ships to meet a new threat. Roughly 200 troops are involved with logistics, 600 involved with aerospace and aviation and 300 forms a recon and security unit leaving around 1,100 personnel fighting as infantrymen and crewing armoured vehicles and artillery pieces.</p>
<p>The Marine Corps is the United States' premier intervention force, specializing in amphibious assault, hostage rescue, and heliborne assault. Although traditionally closely associated with the US Navy, the US Marine Corps has recently made history by being the first military force to deploy its troops away from Earth—first to the International Space Station (ISS) and then to Mars.</p>
<h2 id="the-24th-meu">The 24th MEU</h2>
<p>The 24th MEU is comprised of elements from the 2nd Marine Division and is currently located in the Epsilon Eridani star system, at USSC Base Vigilance. From here it is ready to be deployed out to the Outer Rim when needed. The 24th MEU has operational headquarters at Twentynine Palms Base, in California, which is close to Edwards Space Force Base. The 24th MEU is comprised of around 2,000 Marines, supported by an artillery battery, recon and engineering elements, armoured personnel carriers and orbit-capable military spaceplanes called 'drop-ships'. The unit is transported to any required destination (given time) by US Space Command vertical assault carriers (either the Grissom or the Shepard class).</p>
<p>These are primarily designed to hold, transport and deploy a space-capable MEU and they are on permanent standby to ferry parts of the MEU to anywhere required by order of the US president.</p>
<p>The 24th MEU is commanded by Colonel Oscar Ramirez. His immediate subordinate officers are three Lieutenant Colonels, one commands the MEU's Ground Combat Element (a reinforced battalion of three rifle companies), another commands the MEU's Air Combat Element • the Marine Medium Dropship Squadron 764 (DMM-764), known as "Texas Thunder." The third Lt. Colonel commands the MEU's Combat Support Element (eight platoons, each covering a different speciality, from communications to maintenance, engineering to medical).</p>
<h3 id="infantry">Infantry</h3>
<p>Above all, the Marine Corps is an iS infantry force, all other assets are designed to deliver and support the Marine infantryman in battle. All Marines receive regular combat training, they are tough and have long gone by the nickname of 'leathernecks'. The Marine infantry force of the 24th MEU is provided by the 1st Battalion of the 8th Marine Regiment (part of the 2nd Division) (shortened to '1/8 Marines'). The battalion has three rifle companies, a weapons (ie. support) company and an HQ company. Companies are lettered phonetically (Bravo Company, Alpha Company, etc.).</p>
<p>The rifle company, each commanded by a captain, is the basic fighting unit of the Marine Corps. It is comprised of three rifle platoons (of three squads each) along with a command group and a weapons (support) platoon. Platoons are led by lieutenants. It is the 13-man squads that do the dirty work, each is led by a sergeant and often divided into three teams (each commanded by a corporal). All riflemen are equipped with an M24A1 8.85mm advanced combat rifle (firing caseless ammunition), the Hewison M5 Integrated Combat Suit and an M9 Eagle-Eye short-range disposable missile.</p>
<p>The primary transport of the Marines is the Advanced Motors ARCC-50 (Armored Combat Carrier) The 140 men of the three rifle companies are carried into battle and out on long• range patrol by ten ARCCs. Each ARCC is a well-armoured hostile environment rover with complete life support systems for one month, advanced imaging systems and electronic to defences, with a cabin able to carry a 13-man squad. The crew of the ARCC is two: driver and gunner/commander. For self-defence, the standard personnel carrier version of the ARCC carries a cupola-mounted GAU-122 25mm Gatling gun as well as a dorsal turret mounting two Zenith 52 MW free-electron pulse lasers. Other specialist Marine platoons have their own ARCC variants.</p>
<h3 id="artillery-battery">Artillery Battery</h3>
<p>The MEU includes a battery of six hostile-environment M180 self-propelled railguns. Additional firepower, light reconnaissance, and battlefield protection is provided by turreted Zenith M3 40MW phased plasma guns mounted on two Growler Utility Combat Vehicles.</p>
<h3 id="heavy-weapons">Heavy Weapons</h3>
<p>The weapons company provides fire support and an anti-armour capability with an MQ-6 Phantom combat drone platoon, a heavy weapons platoon with a Zenith M3 40MW phased plasma guns and M65 Gecko Multi-Purpose Missile Launchers (both mounted on eight Growler Utility Combat Vehicles) and an anti-armour platoon equipped with eight Growlers carrying an M-30 Avenger anti-armour missile launchers.</p>
<p>Combat Engineers This platoon supports the breaching of obstacles, building of causeways, bunkers and fortifications as well other structures, it also provides engineering and construction services. It is equipped with a bulldozer and a variety of other equipment.
Armored Recon Platoon Combined with Growlers from the heavy weapons company, this is a mixed platoon used for armed reconnaissance. The platoon typically includes three Growlers (armed with Zenith M3 40MW plasma guns), two Growlers mounted with M-30 Avenger anti-armor missile launchers, and three Matsuyama MQ-6 Phantoms (each with their associated control Growler and transport truck).
Dropships Civilian airlines routinely operate trans atmospheric vehicles or space-planes on Earth that take-off at international airports as jets, then at high-altitudes switch to ramat rockets to propel them into orbit. The Marine Corps have been able to commission a VTOL-capable version for vertical envelopment from orbit, and orbital re-supply. These 'dropships' carry out many of the duties of the helicopter on a terrestrial battlefield. The 24th MEU has sixteen UD-5 Mustang dropships manufactured by Global Dynamics which are all part of the Marine Medium Dropship Squadron 764 (DMM-764), "Texas Thunder". It also boasts fourteen ground-attack variants of the Mustang and two further Mustangs fitted out for the squadron command and control task. Providing heavy lift capabilities are four CS-9 Thunderchief shuttles, also from "Texas Thunder". Each Mustang must fulfil variety of battlefield roles, most important of which is troop transport dropping an ARCC and its passengers directly onto a planetary surface. Additional duties include general transport, recon, tactical air support for the ground forces (especially the ARCC and its squad), forward observation, medevac and search and rescue. As an air support platform the dumpy but powerful Mustang boasts a forward firing 25mm Gatling Gun and two rocket pods each carrying twelve 70mm unguided rockets.
Snipers The headquarters company of the MEU includes the Surveillance and Target Acquisition (STA) Platoon. These guys are snipers, trackers, artillery fire directors and even forward air controllers. The STA may be inserted by dropship into enemy territory, and the platoons have pioneered the dangerous technique of the ACOR jump. This is an Ablative Canopy Orbital Re-entry, where individual Marines climb inside ablative re-entry balls just in 2m in diameter and fall through the atmosphere, surviving the heat of re-entry to land safely on a parawing at a pre-determined Landing Zone. There were many fatalities while perfecting the ACOR jump. The snipers work in teams of two, both armed with M1000 30MW Laser Rifles.
Recon Marines Recon Marines are an elite, toughened and highly trained Marines carrying out dangerous reconnaissance work ahead of any assault. These troops gather intelligence and therefore try to avoid contact with the enemy. They are masters of stealth. Like the snipers of the STA, the Recon Marines have been practicing ACOR jumps with some success. A more common (and safer) method of insertion is via is drop-ship or HALO jump (high-altitude low-opening). A number of non-standard weapons are carried by Recon Marines to fit the missions they are given. Additional missions include antiterrorist work and hostage rescue as well as artillery forward observation and path finding. One platoon of Recon Marines is always attached to the 24th MEU. This platoon has four teams of four men and is commanded by a lieutenant.
Intelligence Teams The ME headquarters element includes an S-2 officer (Captain Robert Hauk) heading an intelligence section covering interrogation, image interpretation, counter-intelligence support, cartography and electronic surveillance/ interpretation.</p></div>
