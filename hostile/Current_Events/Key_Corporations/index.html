    <h1 id="key-corporations">Key Corporations</h1>
<p>The following corporations are powerful and dynamic, having a bold and aggressive place in the interstellar economy. All are part of a conglomerate, but will still appear in RPG scenarios as patrons, antagonists, allies or obstacles. This list is not iS exhaustive, but merely representative of the types of corporations trading in 2350.</p>
<h2 id="ellis-itami">Ellis-Itami</h2>
<p>Ellis-Itami is an information corporation and feared for that. It seems to have an unprecedented data network. E-I owns insurance subsidiaries, a detective agency, stock traders, several small Japanese banking companies, and Kodai-Secure, the famous courier and security firm. Information is Ellis-Itami's game, and the business leadership has a reputation for hiring the brightest cyberspace cowboys and the best investigators. Trying to be impartial, they sell all data to all corporations, all governments: everyone. Much feared is the E-I credit section hired by other firms to collect debts. These 'repo men' are basically hired guns, ronin and street scum.</p>
<h2 id="haruna-biolabs">Haruna Biolabs</h2>
<p>This corporation deals in medical services, drugs and genetic treatments. Haruna previously did some bio-weapons designs for the Japanese Self Defence Force but this was stopped when the viral agent Delta-2 contaminated food supplies, water and some areas back in the early 23rd century. Many deaths ensued, but no one was ever certain who was actually responsible. The government blamed a radical terrorist group called the Imperial Restoration League. Haruna, for its part, suspects Makita Genetics of trying (in vain) to discredit Haruna and win the military contract for itself. In mutual fear, both corporations are at a virtual full-scale war. The people of Tokyo and the Asia Pacific Partnership are bracing themselves for further violence. Haruna's network of clinics and hospitals are run by a subsidiary called Life Corp.</p>
<p>Haruna has spent almost a century at the forefront of human genetics research, perfecting vat-grown organs tailored for a specific donor, and specializing in genetic treatments. In the last two years, however, Los Angeles-based Haruna has become known for its high-end human cloning program. Immortality has been discovered through the perpetual cloning of one's own body and the transfer of one's own living memories into a new, virile body. It is quite legal to purchase a Clone Insurance Policy of $20,000 per month. It involves visiting one of Haruna's high-end clinics and providing tissue samples ready for cloning when the customer dies. The customer also provides an initial memory recording which costs an additional $50,000 and is kept in a Superconducting Memory Unit (SMU). These are bulky machines kept in sub-zero basements that always self-erase whenever they play someone's memories into their clone body. Updates are free.</p>
<p>When a Haruna customer dies, the company picks up his body (or head at the very least) and takes the last recording of the corpse's memories if possible, for implanting it into the clone that is being force-grown. Growing a clone to full maturity (around 30 years old) takes one month and requires a valid death certificate in order to prevent cloning someone still alive which is a gross criminal act in international law. The new clone is the original person in international law.</p>
<p>A force-grown clone that does not have a memory transferred into it is illegal. The clone has no memories at all, no emotions, and is psychologically unstable. It creates its own emotional reactions that can be very dangerous. In 2209, activists broke into the Munich headquarters of the company and exposed the fact that memory-less clones were being created purely to supply replacement organs for their VIP donors. Several hundred memory-less clones escaped and most of those have not yet been recaptured or terminated. This Munich Uprising is described later in the section (see Lebkuchen). Since that embarrassing fiasco in 2209, Haruna has developed the Superconducting Memory Unit and perfected its legitimate, legal and potentially very profitable clone replacement program. Policyholders are few at the moment, mainly due to cost and the stigma that still surrounds the Munich Uprising.</p>
<h2 id="kinako">Kinako</h2>
<p><em>Food is in short supply in 2350. Ten billion people are hungry and little enough land exists to feed them all on the diets that have typically served Mankind.</em></p>
<p>So runs the Kinako advertising—the corporation has revolutionized agriculture with genetically-modified soya to create four distinct, diverse and very different eating experiences. In essence, kinako yellow, kinako green, kinako brown and kinako red can be formed into the likeness of many different types of recognisable foodstuffs. It is on the menu of supermarkets, restaurants and starship canteens throughout human space. Kinako is a giant amongst food retailers and also produces soft drinks, alcohol, consumer goods and household items.</p>
<h2 id="red-dragon-beer">Red Dragon Beer</h2>
<p><em>A decent beer is hard to come by especially in the Outer Rim. Don't get left out in the Cold. Red Dragon beer—be a part of it.</em></p>
<p>If you're in space, you drink Red Dragon that's just going to be a fact. You may get hold of L-4 Lager when the Dragon runs out, but when it's back in stock, you pop the cap and sip that taste of home.</p>
<h2 id="makita-genetics">Makita Genetics</h2>
<p>A market leader in genetics and the creator of Retrogenics™, the science of retroactively splicing and force-growing animal or engineered DNA into a host. Retrogenics technology is experimental and not licenced for use on humans. The chairman of Makita is the mysterious Taneo Tomita, a virtual recluse in the Tokyo Sky Tower that serves as the corporation's global headquarters. The corporation spends a great deal on its public image and the corp is seen as the first of a new kind of company that could change the world and the destiny of the human race purely through genetics. The company has incorporated several medical companies including Alcor, the 1970s cryogenics firm. Makita made the cryonics breakthrough that now allows full-body freezing (or 'stasis') using the now ubiquitous hypersleep chamber. Makita's rival is Haruna Biolabs.</p>
<h2 id="nortinghouse">Nortinghouse</h2>
<p>Nortinghouse has been building nuclear reactors since the days of the Cold War, back in the 1950s. It worked with NASA on various nuclear thermal rocket designs in the 1970s and helped to kick-start the revolution in space transportation almost a hundred years later with its gas core reactor designs. Constantly in competition with smaller, newer firms, Nortinghouse is an adaptable and energetic corporation, reinventing its self constantly. It not only produces good quality fusion reactors but also solar cells, life support systems, plasma rocket systems, space suits and even something as humble as zero-G power tools. Nortinghouse is the epitome of reliability.</p>
<h2 id="parkfield-biolabs">Parkfield Biolabs</h2>
<p>Parkfield's operations include agri-chemicals, genetics, biocides and pesticides. Its HQ is in Toronto and its CEO is James Parkfield Jnr. Parkfield owns a large Canadian Agri-Corp specialising in genetic manipulation to produce genetically superior crops and associated crop enhancers. Parkfield owns huge areas of farmable land in Canada, Brazil, and Russia. The corporation's main laboratory ('Rockwell') is situated in a mountain-side complex that extends deep into the Rocky Mountains. There is some speculation that the complex is responsible for many of the more accessible synthetic street drugs.</p>
<h2 id="star-envoy-club">Star Envoy Club</h2>
<p>The Star Envoy Club is a Hong Kong-based organization that aims to make interstellar travel as bearable (or as the club says 'enjoyable') as possible for its members. It is most often used by corporate executives and other wealthy businessmen who are the only people who can really afford the membership fee. The Star Envoy Club maintains small (and very private) hotels and lounges at all class A and class starports that are accessible only to members and their quests. Deals with all the major carriers mean that the Club can offer an elite-class travel ticket to every member once every two months. Tickets not used are lost. Membership of the Club is a privilege and says much about the character's wealth and social standing.</p>
<h2 id="transdyne-cybersystems-tdc">Transdyne Cybersystems (TDC)</h2>
<p>A dedicated robotic manufacturing corporation, TDC builds all kinds of cybersystems, for every possible task. The software division is exemplary and also jealous. It has been known for TDC to release icebreaker software on shareware bulletins in the hope that some desperate cowboy hacker will use it; these programs are often booby-trapped and allow the target corp to trace the perpetrator straight away. TDC has also made radical developments in Artificial Intelligence and uses AI technology in many robotic and software applications. Fully aware androids are now on the production line and very popular with high-end security firms, space agencies, SWAT teams, seabed exploration companies and rescue services. The lifelike qualities of this fourth generation of human robots are staggering, and many people can be easily fooled by the Transdyne products. Just as with the earlier generations of human robots, modern androids are extremely complex, sophisticated and expensive. The tasks they are given are typically extraordinarily difficult, dangerous or exacting.</p>
<p>The biggest cyborg sellers are the multi-tasking technician model the Transdyne Cybersystems 70 (selling for around $800,000, equivalent to the cost of a military armoured vehicle) and the combat model Transdyne Cybersystems 110 (selling for around $2 million, roughly equivalent to the cost of an armoured tank).</p>
<p><strong>Yoshiko</strong></p>
<p>A large retail corporation that owns famous the Robot Cafe restaurant chain, many department stores worldwide and clothing, food and household production factories. Yoshiko is a vast, faceless corporation with a very secretive board of directors. No one is sure who make up the board and theories run wild. Yoshiko is pervasive and can seem very frightening. Breakfast cereal bars, toothpaste, shoes, bottles, vending machines... Yoshiko is the consumer glue that keeps the 23rd century together and that provides the products that keep society ticking over. The corporation's symbol of the Japanese rising sun is seen virtually everywhere.</p>
