This power ignores solid objects, and you don't have to be familiar with the location in question\u2014you can specify a location by simply stating the direction and distance. 21 Cryokinesis: You can freeze up to 5 cubic meters of material. Cryokinesis can also be used offensively: attack a target within handgun range with a +3 damage modifier. 22 Electrokinesis: You can manipulate electrical energy in your vicinity while you maintain concentration. You can use this power to recharge batteries, short-circuit electrical devices, or generate spectacular light shows. Electrokinesis can also be used offensively: attack a target within handgun range with a +3 damage modifier. Mechanical or electronic targets grant an advantage to your attack. 23 Emotion: You can evoke powerful emotions in a target within 10 meters; fear, joy, or friendliness are typical emotions.

This effect lasts until the end of the battle or for 1D6x10 minutes. 24 Empathy: You can read a target\u2019s emotions and subtly affect them. This effect includes changing a target\u2019s reaction roll result by one category up or down. 25 False perception: You can cause a single target within 10 meters to hallucinate. This effect lasts as long as you concentrate on maintaining it. The details of the false perception are up to you, but it can range from a typical illusion or distraction to something that closely resembles a drug-fueled fugue state. 26 Hibernation: You can enter a trance-like state and meditate for up to 7 days. While meditating, you don't require food, water, or air. You remain aware of your surroundings and can end your hibernation at will. 31 Intuition: You gain +1D3 to your next roll, regardless of what the roll is for. 32 Invisibility: You can conceal yourself from nearby onlookers. While invisible, organic targets can't see you. This power works on electronic sensors and video cameras within a 10-meter range. You must concentrate on this power to be effective.

This power can't pinpoint the exact whereabouts of a target, but it gives you a general sense of the location of a hidden interlocutor or sniper. 41 Memory block: To use this talent, you must be within 10 meters of a target. Roll an attack, and if the attack succeeds, you can block up to 15 minutes of the target\u2019s memories. Additional memories can be targeted with an attack for each use of this talent.  This talent can also be reversed to restore previously blocked memories. 42 Microkinesis: You gain telekinetic control of tiny or microscopic objects. Gain an advantage on any roll involving components or systems containing tiny or microscopic objects.

They can still speak. 46 Mind shield: You erect an invisible mental shield centered on yourself that protects yourself and all allies within close range from any mind-affecting power or psionic ability. The mind shield lasts for the duration of the battle. Roll +CREATIVE to block a psionic attack. If the roll fails, the shield collapses. 51 Precognition: Ask the GM one question about what might happen to your character in the next 24 hours. The GM will respond truthfully with either \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d Precognition can be used only once per session. 52 Psychic healing: You heal 1D3 points of damage on an injured target. The target can't receive psychic healing again until they suffer subsequent damage. 53 Pyrokinesis: You can ignite a flammable object within 10 meters. Pyrokinesis can also be used offensively: attack a target within handgun range with a +2 damage modifier. The target, if hit, is also burning. Burning causes 1 point of damage each round for 1D3 rounds or until extinguished. 54 Recover: You can remove 1 negative effect on a target, such as poisoning, burning, fatigue, or 1D6 stress. 55 Second wind: You can ignore stress and fatigue for 1 hour. 56 Suggestion: You can plant a simple hypnotic suggestion in one target. This effect lasts until the target has performed their suggested task or 10 minutes have passed. Targets won't obey suggestions to harm themselves directly or indirectly. 61 Telekinesis: You can move objects that weigh up to 100 kilograms with the power of your mind. Telekinesis can also be used offensively by hurling an object: attack a target within handgun range with a +0 to +3 damage modifier, depending on the size of the hurled object, per the GM\u2019s discretion. 62 Telepathy: You can read a target\u2019s surface thoughts for one minute. 63 Thousand faces: You can change a target's appearance and biometric data to those of any other target of the same or similar species for 10 minutes. To mimic the specific biometric data of another person, you must have a sample of the target\u2019s DNA. 64 Truth: You can force a target to answer questions truthfully. The target must be able to speak or communicate with you, and the questions can be about anything\u2014the target will fully answer to the best of their ability. 65 Vampire: When you make an unarmed attack at melee range, the vampire talent inflicts a +1 damage modifier on the target and instantly heals you half the damage. 66 Zombie: You can control the body of a creature killed in the past 24 hours. The target creature must be within 10 meters, and the power lasts up to 1D6 combat rounds. The corpse acts, speaks, and attacks as you want while you maintain concentration. The creature\u2019s abilities might be limited depending on the amount and kind of damage that it suffered when it died."},{"location":"character/#drives","title":"Drives","text":"<p>Each member of the team must have a unique drive.
