The rules are minimal and encourage a narrative-based approach to roleplay. The game can also easily accommodate non-paranormal modern military roleplaying adventures by removing the troopers\u2019 psionic abilities.</p> <p>The idea for this game occurred after several sessions of the Traveller sci-fi roleplaying game at my table that leaned hard into tactical adventures. If you\u2019ll pardon the pun, I wanted to bring this concept \u201cback to Earth\u201d and remove the sci-fi trappings of laser guns and spaceships. The result is a modern military adventure game with a twist: psionics.</p> <p>Modern military RPGs are not all that numerous in our hobby, so I hope you enjoy playing PSIOPS and find it somewhat unique. I\u2019d enjoy hearing how your sessions go or if you have any questions or comments. </p> <p>Now, PUFO in five, sprog!</p> <p>Cheers,</p> <p>Zachary Taylor February 2024 Mastodon: @joemoose@dice.camp</p>"},{"location":"advancement/","title":"Character Advancement","text":"<p>Characters start at level 1.</p> <p>Your character advances in level by completing missions.

The character is skilled in the art of small talk and making others feel at ease in their presence in almost any social situation, such as a party, ball, inauguration, bar hopping, etc.</p> <p>Gambling</p> <p>The individual is well informed on games of chance and wise in their play. They have an advantage over non-experts and can generally win when engaged in such games. Gambling, however, should not be confused with general risk-taking.</p> <p>Leadership</p> <p>The character can rally, inspire, organise, and direct team efforts to ensure the best cooperation and productivity possible.</p> <p>Linguistics</p> <p>The character can read and write a different language for every level of Linguistics they possess. All characters can speak and read their native language without needing linguistics skills, and automated computer translator programs mean that linguistics skills are not always needed. Having Linguistics-0 implies that the character has many simple phrases in many languages. In addition, Linguistics can be used to attempt to decipher the general meaning of a preserved specimen of language, such as an inscription or a recorded message.</p> <p>Liaison</p> <p>The character is trained in dealing with others, including knowledge of proper protocols, manners of address, codes of conduct, and other information needed when dealing with a wide range of societal types. Such a character is helpful when attempting to negotiate a particularly edgy deal, convince the tribal leader to assist the team, help settle a dispute between two opposing groups, or perform other acts of negotiation and diplomacy.</p> <p>Steward</p> <p>The Steward skill allows the character to serve and care for troops or (in civilian life) customers. This includes knowledge of concierge duties, housekeeping services, meal preparation and presentation, personal grooming assistance and valet service, and proper social etiquette.</p> <p>Streetwise</p> <p>A character with the Streetwise skill understands the urban environment and the power structures in society. A skilled character knows where to go for information, how to handle strangers without offending them, and who can handle activities bordering on the fringe of legality.</p>"},{"location":"skills/#transportation","title":"Transportation","text":"<p>Motorboats</p> <p>This skill grants the ability to manoeuvre and perform routine maintenance on small motorised watercraft properly.</p> <p>Ocean Ships</p> <p>This skill grants the ability to properly manoeuvre and perform routine maintenance on large motorised sea-going ships.</p> <p>Parachute</p> <p>The skill and practice of jumping from an aeroplane and landing with a static-line or steerable parachute.
