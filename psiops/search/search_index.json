The rules are minimal and encourage a narrative-based approach to roleplay. The game can also easily accommodate non-paranormal modern military roleplaying adventures by removing the troopers\u2019 psionic abilities.</p> <p>The idea for this game occurred after several sessions of the Traveller sci-fi roleplaying game at my table that leaned hard into tactical adventures. If you\u2019ll pardon the pun, I wanted to bring this concept \u201cback to Earth\u201d and remove the sci-fi trappings of laser guns and spaceships. The result is a modern military adventure game with a twist\u2014psionics.</p> <p>The document is divided into two parts: the first covers the basics of character creation and gameplay for the players, and the second provides advice for the GM running the game.</p> <p>Modern military RPGs are not all that numerous in our hobby, so I hope you enjoy playing PsiOps and find it somewhat unique. I\u2019d enjoy hearing how your sessions go or if you have any questions or comments. </p> <p>Now, PUFO in five, sprog!</p> <p>Cheers,</p> <p>Zachary Taylor April 2023 Mastodon: @joemoose@dice.camp</p>"},{"location":"advancement/","title":"Advancement","text":"<p>Characters start at level 1.</p> <p>Your character advances in level by completing missions.

The GM will describe possible complications or outcomes to help in your decision-making.</p> <p>DICE POOLS</p> <p>To roll for a skill in the dice pool version, grab several six-sided dice equal to your skill level plus your current score in the attribute connected to that skill. These are your base dice. Then roll all the dice together.</p> <p>SUCCESS: To succeed with your action, you must roll at least one 6. A 6 is called a success. If you roll several 6s, you get several successes.</p> <p>NO SKILL? If you don\u2019t have the skill required for the particular action you want to perform, you can roll anyway \u2013 simply roll the base dice for your attribute alone.</p> <p>GEAR: Useful gear can give you extra base dice to roll.</p> <p>MULTIPLE SUCCESSES If you roll two or more successes, you reach your stated goal but also gain some additional bonus effect, depending on the situation and the skill used. In combat, extra successes can increase the damage done. For other skills, you can suggest a bonus effect yourself. The GM has the final say. Some suggestions:</p> <p>\u2726 You act quickly. \u2726 You act quietly. \u2726 You help another character. \u2726 You impress someone. \u2726 You discover something unexpected.</p> <p>MORE SUCCESSES: Rolling three or even more successes generally only matters in combat, where each additional will increase the damage done by one point.</p> <p>PUSHING YOUR ROLL Your initial skill roll reflects a safe and controlled action. If you fail your initial roll, or if you want additional successes, you can lean into the action, giving it everything you\u2019ve got, pushing yourself to the limit. This is called pushing the roll, and lets you re-roll any dice that don\u2019t show the result of 1. A base die showing a 1 is called a bane and can never be re-rolled when pushing. After a push, you cannot change back to the previous result. All dice count after the push, even any dice you didn\u2019t re-roll. COST OF PUSHING Pushing always comes with a risk or a cost. These vary greatly depending on the game and the version of the YZE you use. The push mechanic is generally the best place to highlight the core themes of an YZE game. Several options follow below.</p> <p>ONLY ONE CHANCE As a rule, you only have one chance to succeed with any action. Once you have rolled the dice \u2013 and pushed the roll \u2013 you may not roll again to achieve the same goal. You need to try something different or wait until the circumstances have changed in a substantial way. Or let another player character try. This rule does not apply to combat, where you can attack the same enemy multiple times. MODIFIERS Sometimes, external factors help you to succeed. Such mod- ifiers will give you additional base dice to roll (in the dice pool version) or step your base dice to bigger dice (in the step dice version). Other times, something hampers your action. This removes base dice from your pool (dice pool version) or downsteps your base dice (step dice). You can get such modifiers to skill rolls in several different ways: specialties, the difficulty of the action itself, and help from others. DICE POOL MODIFIERS A +1 modifier means you roll one extra base die, +2 means you roll two extra base dice, and so on. A \u22121 modifier means you roll one base die fewer than normal, \u22122 means two fewer, and so on. Several modifiers can apply to the same roll, and they are cumulative. Always add and remove base dice from your skills, if you can (not from attributes or gear). If you don\u2019t have enough dice from skills, remove base dice from gear. If you run out of gear dice as well, remove base dice from attributes. If you end up with no dice at all, you have no chance to succeed \u2013 time to rethink your strategy!</p>"},{"location":"play/#using-attributes","title":"Using Attributes","text":"<p>Your character is a determined, resourceful special forces operative capable of doing almost anything.

Psionic teleportation is limited to the movement of the teleported character's body and (for highly skilled teleporters) their clothing and other possessions.</p> Teleportation Difficulty Timing Cost Teleport self, unclothed Average (+0) 1D6 seconds 0+Range Teleport self, light load Disadvantage (-1) 1D6 seconds 2+Range Teleport self, moderate load Disadvantage (-1) 1D6 seconds 3+ Range Teleport self, heavy load Disadvantage (-1) 1D6 seconds 4+Range [Teleportation] <p>Teleportation always involves the movement of one's body to another location. Independent items or other individuals may not be moved. Teleportation involves specific requirements to be accurate and to ensure obedience to the laws of physics.</p>"},{"location":"psionics/#pre-knowledge-of-destination","title":"Pre-Knowledge of Destination","text":"<p>A character must always have a mental image of their destination before teleporting. This mental image is acquired by visiting the location first (or viewing it from a distance), having the mental image implanted in one's mind (by telepathy) by another person who has visited the destination, or by viewing the location through clairvoyance. The key to remember is that someone has actually to view the location\u2014recorded images are not enough.</p>"},{"location":"psionics/#energy-and-momentum","title":"Energy and Momentum","text":"<p>Teleportation involves severe movement restrictions to ensure energy conservation and momentum.</p> <p>Teleportation is restricted to jumps of 500 meters or less. Upon arrival, jumping between 250 to 500 meters involves disorientation for 20 to 120 seconds (2D6x10). Jumps between 25 and 150 meters involve disorientation for 2 to 12 seconds (2D6).   Jumping less than 25 meters involves no disorientation. </p> <p>This restriction results from the law of conservation of momentum: two locations have different rotational speeds and directions. A jump from a point on the Earth's equator to one of its poles would result in a total velocity difference between the character and his surroundings of over 3300 kph, leading to a messy and instantaneous death.</p> <p>Teleporting to or from vehicles traveling at high speed can also result in energy gains or losses. When teleporting into, onto, or out of a fast-moving vehicle, the psion takes damage as if the vehicle had rammed them at the difference in starting and ending velocities.</p> <p>Changes in altitude result in potential energy changes, manifesting as changes in core body temperature. A jump of one kilometer straight down results in a temperature increase of 2.5 degrees Celsius\u2014sufficient to cause extreme fever, brain damage, and even death. A jump upwards will cool the body by the same amount, with equally serious results.</p> <p>To be safe, a jump may not involve an elevation change of more than 400 meters, and multiple jumps should not involve a cumulative elevation change or more than 600 meters in one hour.     </p>"},{"location":"psionics/#range","title":"Range","text":"<p>Psionic range costs are paid based on range bands as follows.</p> Range Distance to Target Awareness ESP Telekinesis Telepathy Teleportation Personal less than 1.5 meters - 0 0 0 1 Close 1.5 to 3 meters - 0 2 1 1 Short 3 to 12 meters - 1 4 1 2 Medium 12 to 50 meters - 1 5 2 2 Long 51 meters to 250 meters - 2 7 2 3 Very Long 251 meters to 500 meters - 2 9 3 3 Distant 501 meters to 5 km - 3 - 3 4 Very Distant 5 km to 500 km - 3 - 4 - Regional 50 km to 500 km - 4 - 4 - Continental 500 km to 5000 km - 4 - 5 - [Psionic Range Costs]"}]}
