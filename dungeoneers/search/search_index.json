This guide is for players\u2014it\u2019s the resource I hand to new players at my table. It contains all the information you need to create your character, equip them, and head out on adventures.</p> <p>If you\u2019re new to tabletop roleplaying games, I\u2019d suggest you read Fundamentals of Tabletop Roleplaying by Levi Kornelsen. Kornelsen provides a clear introduction to all aspects of this type of game, and his book is a good resource for anyone new to the hobby.</p> <p>Dungeoneers grew out of a desire for a specific style of play. Call it \"old school.\" I wanted a game that encourages player ingenuity over character abilities, a game that weaves an emergent story from conversations between the players and GM. To do something, you need only to describe it. The rules stay well out of the way until needed by the GM\u2014perhaps to decide an uncertain outcome. The GM will let you know if and when you need to roll dice. Description and observation are a player\u2019s toolkit, not some system of rules.</p> <p>As such, Dungeoneers does not use traditional character classes. The equipment your character carries and your own resourcefulness define your character's abilities. You won't \"use\" your character sheet to look up a specific power for a particular problem. To be a warrior, find the best armor and weapons you can afford. A thief needs tools. A mage needs a spell. Be all three? Certainly.</p> <p>Additionally, combat is highly consequential. Every foe is deadly and can defeat you in a few rounds. There's no back-and-forth slog of dice rolling, standing toe-to-toe, and trading a series of blows that might or might not hit. Attacks always hit; you only roll damage. There's no \"encounter balance.\" Combat is a puzzle to solve rather than a simulation of attrition. You must gain tactical advantages and defeat opponents quickly and overwhelmingly or else retreat and try a different approach.</p> <p>Since your character\u2019s equipment is essential to their capabilities, tracking their gear is part of the game. But I don\u2019t like bookkeeping, so inventory is a simple mechanic: 12 slots maximum for equipment and mark usage on consumables. That's it.</p> <p>This game also has a luck system to encourage some crazy risk-taking. You are a heroic adventurer, after all.</p> <p>Enjoy!</p> <p>Zachary Taylor  </p>"},{"location":"advancement/","title":"Leveling Up","text":""},{"location":"advancement/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Your character earns Experience Points (XP) by bringing treasure and valuable relics back from their expeditions to the safety of a settlement.</p> <p>For every coin\u2019s worth of treasure brought back (divided equally amongst the party), your character earns 1 XP.</p>"},{"location":"advancement/#level","title":"Level","text":"<p>Characters start at level 1 with zero XP.</p> <p>The following table shows the total XP required to advance each level.</p> <p>Level and XP Table</p> Level HP Stamina XP 1 d4+2 0 0 2 2d6 1 1000 3 3d6 2 3000 4 3d6 2 6000 5+ 3d6 3 +5000 <p>When your character earns enough XP to advance to the next level, perform the following actions:</p> <ul> <li>Roll for attribute increase: Roll 3d6 for each attribute: STR, DEX, WIL, and LUCK.

The local tavern keeper is far less amicable. 2 Minor misunderstanding with the local watch that you can\u2019t smooth over. You spend the next d6 days locked up. You are all now seen as local troublemakers. 3 One of you insulted a local person of rank. They will hold a grudge unless you all publicly apologize and humiliate yourself before them. 4 Hangover from hell. Take a Hungover constraint. All checks have a disadvantage until a long rest. 5 Gambling binge. Your party owes a collective debt equal half the amount spent carousing to someone you'd rather not own money to. 6 You've ruined the local economy! Your excess spending means that all prices double until the next session. 7 While in a drunken stupor and a spot of trouble, you sought refuge in a temple. The acolytes cared for you but have begun hounding you to perform a charitable act as repayment. 8 Due to a lost game of axe throwing and a few inflammatory remarks at the tavern, you make bitter enemies with a local rival adventuring party. 9 Beaten and robbed. A bunch of thugs waylays you during your drunken carousing. Collectively lose 2d6 x 50 coins. 10 Bad Investment. Invest all your spare coins in some smooth-tongued merchant's scheme. It turns out it's a sham. One of the town\u2019s merchants flees. 11 Major misunderstanding with the local watch. You are locked up for 2d6 days, and all equipment is confiscated until fines and bribes totaling 2d6 x 50 coins are paid. You all are now seen as local criminals. 12+ The roof! The roof! The roof is on fire! You accidentally start a conflagration. Roll d6: (1\u20132) you burned down your favorite tavern, (3\u20135) some other establishment is reduced to ash, or (6) a big chunk of town goes up in smoke. Roll d6 again: (1\u20132) no one knows it was you, (3\u20135) one other person knows you did it, or (6) everyone knows. <p>Carousing Fortunes Table</p> d6+ Fortune 1 Jackpot! One of you strikes it rich at the gambling tables! Gain 2d6 \u00d7 50 coins. 2 Gain a local reputation as the life of the party! Those of questionable reputation are much more friendly and see you as one of their own. 3 Whoa, what a trip! The strange powder you sniffed revealed mystic truths about the universe. Younger people are much more friendly and see you as one of their own. 4 Well fed, well rested, and ready to go! Your first attribute check of the day has an advantage. 5 Citizens arrest! You catch a criminal in the act and restrain them until the watch arrives. You are seen as a hero by the settlement. 6 The local blacksmith, due to your influx of coins, has been able to fashion an exquisite weapon that he's willing to sell for the normal price. 7 The local temple acolytes see you as protectors of the settlement. They offer you a blessing before your next adventure. 8 Impressed by your ability to drink for days and keep standing, a local hireling of high repute will join you on your next adventure if you wish. 9 Outstanding Investment! Invest all your spare cash in some smooth-tongued merchant's scheme. It turns out it's real! It returns d4 x 10% profits next d4 sessions. 10 Local celebrity. Your ability to revel with the common folk has led them to see you as one of their own, and they are thankful to have you around. You receive free room and board in this settlement. 11 Hot Gossip. Your time spent carousing let you in on some juicy rumors. You learn one major secret about a person of note. 12+ Heroic Carousing! It was a night of truly epic debauchery. Roll d6 to see how your legend grew. (1) Re-roll HP for your level; swap the new result if higher, or increase by 1 if lower. (2) Gain 1 STR. (3) Gain 1 DEX. (4) Gain 1 WIL. (5) Gain 1 LUCK.

The creature or object created exists for as many rounds equal to twice the essence spent. The creation is, at most, the size or weight of the sorcerer.

The ward provides an advantage on attribute checks to avoid magical effects and impairs damage from physical attacks. The ward moves with its target.
