This guide is for players. It\u2019s the resource I hand to new players at my table. It contains all the information you need to create your character, equip them, and head out on adventures.</p> <p>If you\u2019re new to tabletop roleplaying games, I\u2019d suggest you read Fundamentals of Tabletop Roleplaying by Levi Kornelsen. Kornelsen provides a clear introduction to all aspects of this type of game, and his book is a good resource for anyone starting the hobby.</p> <p>Dungeoneers grew out of a desire for a specific style of play. Call it \"old school.\" I wanted an adventure roleplaying game that encourages player ingenuity over character abilities, a game that weaves an emergent story from conversations between the players and GM. To do something, you need only to describe it. The rules stay well out of the way until needed by the GM\u2014perhaps to decide a risky and uncertain outcome. The GM will let you know if and when you need to roll dice. Description and observation are a player\u2019s toolkit, not some system of rules.</p> <p>As such, Dungeoneers doesn\u2019t use traditional character classes. Your character's abilities are defined by the equipment your character carries and your own resourcefulness. You won't \"use\" your character sheet to look up a specific power for a particular problem. To be a warrior, find the best armor and weapons you can afford. A thief needs tools. A mage needs a spell. Do all three? Certainly.</p> <p>Additionally, combat is highly consequential. Every foe is deadly and can defeat you in a few rounds. There's no back-and-forth slog of dice rolling, standing toe-to-toe, and trading a series of blows that might or might not hit. Attacks always hit; you only roll damage. There's no \"encounter balance.\" Combat is a puzzle to solve rather than a simulation of attrition. You must gain tactical advantages, defeat opponents quickly and overwhelmingly, or retreat and try a different approach.</p> <p>Since your character\u2019s equipment is essential to their capabilities, tracking their gear is part of the game. But I\u2019m not too fond of bookkeeping, so inventory is a simple mechanic: 12 slots maximum for equipment and mark usage on consumables. That's it.</p> <p>This game also has a luck system to encourage some crazy risk-taking. You are a heroic adventurer, after all.</p> <p>Enjoy!</p> <p>Zachary Taylor June 2024 Mastodon: @dice.camp@joemoose</p>"},{"location":"appendix-a-reference/","title":"Appendix A: Rules Reference","text":""},{"location":"appendix-a-reference/#best-practices","title":"Best Practices","text":"<ul> <li>Engage and collaborate with your GM and other players.
