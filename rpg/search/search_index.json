Neutrality The GM's role is to portray the rules, situations, NPCs, and narrative while acting as a neutral arbiter. Classless A single class does not limit a character's role or skills. Instead, the equipment they carry and their experiences define their speciality. Death Characters may be powerful, but they are also vulnerable to harm in many forms. Death is always around the corner, but it is never random or without warning. Fiction First Dice do not always reflect an obstacle's difficulty or its outcome. Instead, the GM arbitrates success and failure in dialogue with the players, based on in-world elements. Growth Characters are changed through in-world advancement, gaining new skills and abilities by surviving dangerous events and overcoming obstacles. Player Choice Players should always understand the reasons behind the choices they've made, and the GM provides information about potential risks freely and frequently. Principles The GM and the players agree to general principles that foster a specific play experience defined by critical thinking, exploration, and an emergent narrative. Shared Objectives Players trust one another to engage with the shared setting, character goals, and party challenges. Therefore, the party is typically working together towards a common goal as a team. Principles for Game Masters GMs abide by these general principles. Information Provide useful information about the game world as the characters explore it. Players do not need to roll dice to learn about their circumstances. Be helpful and direct with your answers to their questions. Respond honestly, describe consistently, and always let them know they can keep asking questions. Difficulty Default to context and realism rather than numbers and mechanics. If something the players want to do is sincerely impossible, no dice roll will allow them to do it. Is what the player describes and how they leverage the situation sensible? Let it happen. Ability Saves cover many uncertain situations and are often all that is necessary for risky actions. Preparation The game world is organic, malleable, and random. It intuits and makes sharp turns. Use random tables and generators to develop situations, not static stories or plots. NPCs remember what the PCs say and do and how they affect the world. NPCs don't want to die. Infuse their self-interest and will to live into every personality. Narrative Focus Emergent experience of play is what matters, not math or character abilities. Give the players weapon trainers and personal quests to facilitate improvement and specialization. Pay attention to the needs and wants of the players, then put realistic opportunities in their path. A dagger to your throat will kill you, regardless of your expensive armour and special training. Danger The game world produces a real risk of pain and death for the player characters. Telegraph danger to players when it is present. The more dangerous, the more apparent. Put traps in plain sight and let the players take time to figure out a solution. Give players opportunities to solve problems and interact with the world. Choice Give players a solid choice to force outcomes when the narrative lulls. Use binary \"so, A or B?\" responses when their intentions are vague. Work together with this conversational progress to keep the game moving. Ensure that the player character's actions leave their mark on the game world. Principles for Players Players abide by these general principles. Agency Ability scores and related saves do not define your character. They are tools. Don't only ask what your character would do; ask what you would do, too. Be creative with your intuition, items, and connections. Teamwork Seek consensus from the other players before barreling forward. Stay on the same page about goals and limits, respecting each other and accomplishing more as a group than alone. Exploration Asking questions and listening to detail is more valuable than any stats, items, or skills you have. Take the GM's description without suspicion, but never hesitate to clarify or seek more information. There is no single correct way forward. Talking Treat NPCs as if they were real people, and rely on your curiosity to safely gain information and solve problems. You'll find that most people are interesting and will want to talk things through before getting violent. Caution Fighting is a choice and rarely a wise one; consider whether violence is the best way to achieve your goals. Try to stack the odds in your favour and retreat when things seem unfavourable. Planning Think of ways to avoid your obstacles through reconnaissance, subtlety, and fact-finding. Do some research and ask around about your objectives. Ambition Set goals and use your resources to take steps forward. Expect nothing. Earn your reputation. Keep things moving forward and play to see what happens.","title":"Design Principles"},{"location":"2-Design%20Principles/#design-principles","text":"The game design assumes the following principles.

Brawn : fortitude, strength, vigour Finesse : agility, charm, speed Intellect : intelligence, perception, willpower For each Ability, in order, roll 3d6 . If you like, you can then swap any two Ability scores. 3: Hit Protection Hit Protection (HP) measures your character\u2019s capability to avoid severe damage. HP is quickly replenished. Damage first reduces your HP. After your HP is zero, damage then reduces your Brawn. Damage to Brawn represents a more severe injury. Roll 1d6 for your character\u2019s HP. 4: Corruption Players dabbling in sorcery slide down a slippery slope. Magic is volatile and warps its practitioners. Some players may want to avoid these corruptions, while others seek it actively. Your player starts with zero corruption. 5: Classless Many games have fixed character classes or roles you must choose to determine your character\u2019s capabilities. However, you are all dungeoneers, explorers, and ne'er-do-wells seeking adventure and glory in this game. Your character can strap on plate armour and swing a battleaxe as readily as they can cast a spell, pick a lock, sneak in the shadows, or traverse a wilderness. The equipment they carry, Ability scores, and imagination determine your character's capabilities. If you\u2019d like to be a warrior, put your highest Ability score in Brawn and arm yourself with the best weapons and armour that you can acquire. If you prefer a stealthy rogue, make sure you have lock picks and high Finesse. Spell grimoires and a high Intellect will help you along the path of sorcerous arts. Or perhaps a little of all three? Alternately, if you would prefer to play a specific character archetype, see the optional Archetypes table. 6: Background Either choose or roll your character's occupation before becoming an adventurer on the Backgrounds table. Your character's background does not have any particular game effect. The background might suggest something your character knows or a possible contact. 7: Starting Equipment Characters have a total of 10 inventory slots. Most items take up one slot, and small items can sometimes bundle together into a single slot. Bulky items take up two slots and are typically two-handed, heavy, or awkward to carry. A character with a full inventory (filling all slots) has their HP reduced to zero while encumbered. You cannot carry more items than your inventory allows and must drop excess items. All PCs begin with: Rations (4 days) Waterskin (4 days) d6 x5 coins Roll on the Starting Equipment tables to determine what additional equipment, armour, and weapon your character owns. See Equipment for details on the items such as armour value, damage die, and inventory slot attributes.","title":"Making Your Character"},{"location":"3-Making%20a%20Character/#making-your-character","text":"To create your character, follow these steps.","title":"Making Your Character"},{"location":"3-Making%20a%20Character/#1-name-and-traits","text":"Choose your character's sex and then either choose or roll their name and physical traits on the Names and Traits tables.","title":"1: Name and Traits"},{"location":"3-Making%20a%20Character/#2-abilities","text":"Your character has three Abilities scores that measure their general capabilities.

The GM describes the players\u2019 current situation. The players then ask questions and tell what their characters do. The GM explains the results of the players\u2019 actions; the players react and describe more activities, and so on. Suppose the outcome of your character\u2019s actions is not immediately apparent, or the activity is risky. In that case, the GM may ask that you roll dice to determine the results. The GM will answer your questions and will always respect your freedom of choice. The GM will certainly provide challenges, obstacles, and situations to solve and overcome. Still, the game is not a story narrated by the GM. Instead, it\u2019s an interactive fiction built upon your and your fellow players\u2019 decisions. Actions and Ability Saves Actions are anything your character does when interacting with the world, whether it\u2019s haggling with an innkeeper, avoiding a trap, crossing swords with a villain, or invoking the powers of an elder god. Your description of what your character is doing determines the outcome of their Actions. Your character's Actions always succeed as you describe unless there's potential for risk or consequence to the narrative. Ability Saves When your character's Action is risky or could change the narrative, your GM may call for an Ability Save . Your GM tells you what Ability is relevant, and you then roll d20 . If the result is less than your character\u2019s Ability score, the Action succeeds . Otherwise, it fails . Regardless of Ability scores, a roll of 1 always succeeds, while a 20 always fails. Advantage and Disadvantage Suppose careful preparation reduces the risk of an Action or other situational factors. In that case, your GM may grant an Advantage on your Ability Save. If so, you roll an extra d20 and take the lowest single result of the two dice. If an Action has multiple advantages, it may no longer be considered risky and therefore might not require an Ability Save. Conversely, suppose the Action is made riskier by great haste, lack of appropriate gear, or other factors. In that case, your GM may require a Disadvantage on your Ability Save. If so, you roll an extra d20 and take the highest single result of the two dice. Ability Saves with both Advantages and Disadvantages are rolled as usual with one d20. Opposed Actions If opponents are attempting the same Action, the Action is Opposed . For example, your character is holding a door closed while an enemy is forcing it open. To determine an outcome, both opponents make Ability Saves, and the lowest roll succeeds. Aiding and Interfering Player characters can come to the Aid of their companions to help make an Action succeed. Everyone involved makes separate Abilities Saves, and the best result decides the outcome. All characters aiding with the Action potentially share any adverse consequences of a failed Save. Conversely, player characters can Interfere with another player character\u2019s actions and prevent them from succeeding. Everyone involved makes an Ability Save, and the worst roll decides the outcome. Time and Distance Time and distance are abstracted and flexible, depending on the current narrative. Time The game measures time in three durations: Round, Turn, and Watch. Round is the time scale for combat. Each Round is less than a minute. Turn is the time scale for exploration. Each Turn is around 10 minutes, enough time to explore a room and perform an Action or two. Watch is the time scale used when travelling. Each Watch is 36 Turns or about 6 hours. Distance The game measures distance with five zones or bands: Hand, Close, Near, Far, and Distant. Your character can move between adjacent zones in one Round. Hand means the opponents are in physical contact, grappling. Close means that the opponents are within striking distance of hand-held melee weapons. Near means that the opponents are out of striking distance for hand-held melee weapons but within range of weapons with a long reach, such as polearms, thrown weapons, ranged weapons, and spells. Far means the opponents are even further apart, out of range for melee and thrown weapons, but within range of ranged weapons and spells. Distant means the opponents are within sight but entirely out of reach of any weapon or spell. Combat In each Round of combat, your character can move and take one Action or forgo taking an Action and move twice. Each round, you declare what your character is doing before dice are rolled. The GM will indicate the likely actions that your opponents will take. Initiative All players first declare their actions for the round and then determine who goes first as follows: If your opponent is surprised, your character acts before them. If an opponent is not surprised, make a Finesse Save to go before them. Afterwards, declare your actions and roll a Finesse Save at the beginning of each new Round to see who goes first. The lowest roll goes first, and then in order of increasing results. Characters who failed the Finesse Save go after the opponents. Continue doing so until the encounter is over. The subsequent roll may result in one side taking two consecutive actions. Attacks Attacks always hit. The attacker rolls their weapon\u2019s damage die and deals that much damage to their opponent's HP. In situations that make an attack either more or less deadly, the GM may decide that your character\u2019s damage is Enhanced or Impaired . If an attack is Enhanced, such as attacking an unaware target, roll your damage die and an extra d12 . Take the single highest result. If the attack is Impaired, such as firing through cover, roll your damage die and an extra d4 . Take the single lowest result. Armour Before dealing damage to HP, subtract the target's Armor rating from the result of the damage roll. Some weapons and types of attacks with the pierce quality reduce the armour rating for determining damage. Some attacks, such as falling or burning, ignore armour entirely. Sundered Shields If your character has a shield equipped, you could choose to ignore all damage in an attack by sundering their shield. A sundered shield is destroyed. Multiple Attacks If multiple allies in the same zone attack the same opponent, roll each damage separately, but deal the single highest result. Dual Weapons If your character wields two weapons, roll damage for each, but deal the single highest result. Blast Attacks with a blast quality affect all targets in a zone, rolling damage separately for each. Blast refers to anything from explosions to massive cleaving onslaughts to the impact of siege engine projectiles. If unsure how many targets can be affected in the zone, roll the related damage die for the number. Heroic Deeds Heroic Deeds are ad-hoc manoeuvres your character might attempt during combat. Examples include: Disarming an opponent Swinging from a chandelier to knock a target over Leaping onto the back of a giant Shouting a ferocious battle cry to unnerve the enemy Most any deed you can describe within the fiction of the narrative is possible, per GM ruling. Resolving Deeds You declare your character\u2019s deed and do not roll damage. Instead, make an Ability Save that determines whether your character accomplishes their heroic deed. Deeds are crucial to surviving battle. Standing toe-to-toe with an enemy and trading blows might work, but you\u2019ll be taking a considerable risk. Remember that all attacks hit, and you always roll damage\u2014this applies to your opponent\u2019s attacks as well. Coordinate your party\u2019s actions and deeds. Fight dirty. Don\u2019t give an opponent a chance to defeat you. With a crafty deed, the fight might be over before it starts. Critical Deed Saves If you roll a 1 or a 20 on your Ability Save for completing a deed, see the following outcomes. On a 1, the deed succeeds spectacularly without any chance for your opponent to avoid it, and you also roll weapon damage, if applicable. On a 20, the deed fails miserably, and the intended result happens to your character instead. You might be able to make an Ability Save to avoid the deed\u2019s effect. Retreat Running away from a dire situation always requires a successful Finesse Save, as well as a safe destination to run to. Warband Large groups of similar combatants fighting together are treated as a single unit. When a Warband takes critical damage, it is routed. When it reaches zero Brawn, it is destroyed. Attacks against Warbands by individuals are impaired unless they deal blast damage. Attacks against individuals by Warbands are enhanced and always deal blast damage. Damage, Death, and Debilities Damage first reduces your character\u2019s HP. Damage that reduces HP to zero decreases the Brawn Ability score by the amount remaining. Ability Loss After taking damage to Brawn, roll a Brawn Save. If your Save fails, the damage is a Critical Injury . Your character adds a Fatigue debility to their inventory and is knocked unconscious and out of the fight until revived. Losing HP represents general wear and tear that\u2019s quickly restored and not life-threatening. Damage to Brawn means more grievous harm. Some creatures, poisons, diseases, or spells can potentially damage your character\u2019s other Abilities. Damage to any Ability score is potentially grave. If Brawn is reduced to zero, your character dies. It\u2019s time to roll a new character. If Finesse is reduced to zero, your character can no longer make use of their limbs. If Intellect is reduced to zero, your character is stricken with madness. The GM might determine their actions until the character's Intellect is restored. Scars When damage to your character reduces their HP to exactly zero, they are sometimes changed irrevocably. See the Scars table for details. Deprivation and Fatigue A character deprived of a crucial need (such as food or rest) cannot heal HP or Ability scores. Anyone deprived for more than a day adds a Fatigue to their inventory, one for each day. Each Fatigue occupies one slot and lasts until they can recuperate (such as a whole night's rest in a safe spot). Characters can also gain Fatigue by: casting spells, suffering critical injuries, or through events in the narrative. Healing Resting for a few moments after an encounter restores all lost HP. Ability loss and other serious ailments are more difficult to heal. You can generally recover lost Ability points with a week or two of rest under a healer's care or other source of appropriate expertise. Some of these services are free, while magical or more expedient means of recovery may come at a cost.","title":"Playing the Game"},{"location":"4-Playing%20the%20Game/#playing-the-game","text":"The core of this game is a conversation between players and GM.

Wielded by the rich or the foolhardy, these strange weapons could very well hail from the infernal planes. All dragon-powder gunnes are characterized by the following traits: Unwieldy : All have the dangerous , two-handed , awkward , reload , piercing , and bulky tags, unless otherwise noted. Inaccurate : Requires either an Intellect or a Finesse Save to hit a target before rolling damage. Dangerous : A Critical Miss on the Save to hit a target results in a misfire. Roll on the Misfires table for the result. Armour Piercing : All hand-held gunnes or bombs ignore 4 armour. Gunnes moved by two people or pack animals ignore all armour. Powerful : Enhanced attacks with gunnes roll an extra d20 , impaired d6 . Reloading : Most gunnes require one load of Powder Shot ammunition and can only be fired once before reloading. Preparing another shot takes 1d2 rounds unless otherwise noted and requires two hands. You can\u2019t reload a gunne if an enemy is within melee range. Noisy : Igniting dragon-powder has loud and explosive results. Lesser creatures might flee when hearing the shot. Anything more intelligent will notice and investigate. Remember.

Inaccurate : Requires either an Intellect or a Finesse Save to hit a target before rolling damage. Dangerous : A Critical Miss on the Save to hit a target results in a misfire. Roll on the Misfires table for the result. Armour Piercing : All hand-held gunnes or bombs ignore 4 armour. Gunnes moved by two people or pack animals ignore all armour. Powerful : Enhanced attacks with gunnes roll an extra d20 , impaired d6 . Reloading : Most gunnes require one load of Powder Shot ammunition and can only be fired once before reloading. Preparing another shot takes 1d2 rounds unless otherwise noted and requires two hands. You can\u2019t reload a gunne if an enemy is within melee range. Noisy : Igniting dragon-powder has loud and explosive results. Lesser creatures might flee when hearing the shot. Anything more intelligent will notice and investigate. Remember.
