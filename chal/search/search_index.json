Within the swirling dust, the PCs can see the spectral tracings of towering giants on the march, with the silhouette of blackened cities in their wake. Once sighted, the storm engulfs the PCs in 1d3x10 minutes. The sun is blotted from the sky; the desert descends into darkness, and the howling winds\u2019 shriek eclipses all sounds. Unless the PCs act quickly, they lose track of one another and all sense of direction.The PCs risk suffocation if they fail to escape the storm or find shelter. For each round spent in the storm, each character must Defy Danger. On a failed check, the PC takes 1d6 damage. 2 Raiders: The party stumbles upon a scouting party of 15 mantids. The mantids are hidden in the dunes on either side of the PCs, waiting in ambush. Whether or not the ambush achieves surprise is left up to the judge\u2019s discernment; special precautions, extraordinary luck, or magical allies can all turn the tables on the lurking mantids.If the mantids achieve surprise, they begin the battle with throwing wedges at the party. In the second round, 9 of the mantids charge down the dunes to engage the PCs with polearms, while the remaining 6 hang back to attack archers and spell casters with additional throwing wedges. The mantids\u2019 morale breaks when they lose half their numbers. The Mantids slay their own wounded rather than let them be captured.If any of the mantids are taken prisoner, they refuse to divulge information and will kill themselves if able. Charmed or otherwise ensorcelled mantids suffer no such reservations, readily revealing all they know. 3\u20135 No encounter 6 Refugees: The party is discovered by a band of 5d100 refugees fleeing the wrath of the mantids. The refugees follow in the tracks of scouting parties, and aggressive PCs might mistake them for a war band.Closer inspection quickly reveals the truth. Bleeding and battered, with no water and nearing exhaustion, the band is near collapse and will only survive another day or two in the desert.The band is led by Khitam, a once-proud warrior queen. She expects the PCs to treat her band respectfully and bristles at poor treatment. Still, knowing that the survival of her band depends on the kindness of strangers, Khitam will suffer indignities in the name of her people. However, any injustice will be returned tenfold once Khitam and her people reach civilization.The warrior queen is defended by a troop of eunuchs. Each will eagerly lay down his own life in defense of Khitam. They revere their queen as a living god and tolerate cruelties towards Khitam only on her direct order.Khitam knows roughly the way to Zulot Oasis, and she and her eunuchs can all report on the terrible mantids marching from the ruins. If the safety of her refugees is assured, she is willing to join the party (accompanied by three of her retainers), lending her sword arm to the PCs\u2019 cause. If the PCs suffer losses early in the adventure, the GM can introduce Khitam to reinforce their ranks. However, if the PCs treat the warrior queen poorly, her arrival may cause more harm than good. 7 The Weeping Specter: A spectral figure of a weeping woman, her rags limned with blue fire, appears atop a dune. If approached, the weeping specter beseeches the PCs with pleading eyes, clutching bloody swaddling in her tight fists. Clerics, medicine women, midwives, and their ilk can correctly guess that the ghost is of a woman that lost her child. The specter cannot speak through the sobs, though a successful casting of speak with the dead permits the caster to communicate with the dead mother\u2019s spirit. Only a finger bone is present at the site, but the specter can tap out answers if instructed. The mantids abducted the mother\u2019s family. She escaped with her babe, but the heat of the desert proved too great. The specter can draw a rough map of level 1 and answer rudimentary questions about the mantids.If the PCs attack the specter, it pauses long enough to shriek its horror and rage before vanishing. Every living creature within 300\u2019 automatically takes 1d16 sonic damage and is potentially deafened for 1d4 hours (Defy Danger to resist). Non-PCs (including henchmen, retainers, and animals) must check morale or flee into the desert for 1d4 hours.If the PCs take pains to bury the finger bone, a stream of cool water springs from the hole. The water soothes all hunger and thirst and doubles all healing for 1d4 days.The water loses its potency when carried away from the source. The sole exception is a cleric of Lawful alignment and kindly disposition. These noble souls may carry the water in sanctified vials (for instance, in containers intended for holy water). Doing so preserves the water\u2019s quality for up to ten days. 8 Skyfire: A meteor blazes across the sky, flaring as brightly as the sun, before striking the earth, some 1d5 miles from the PCs. Upon inspection, the PCs discover a blast crater 250 yards across and 50 yards deep. The surrounding sand has melted into rough glass, and heat still rolls from the depths.Characters willing to brave the crater\u2019s base discover a white lotus bloom moist with dew. Each day the lotus weeps 1d3 drops of clear, oily resin. When a resin drop touches the ground, time is frozen for all creatures save for beings within 25\u2019 of the lotus flower. Free characters may take actions per normal until time restarts in 1d5 rounds. The star lotus wilts and loses all its powers after 1 week.If an elf or wizard consumes the flower before the lotus wilts, the character must Defy Danger or succumb to irreversible madness. However, on a successful check, the PC understands 1d4 spells of the judge\u2019s choosing."},{"location":"encounters/#exploring-the-zulot-ruins","title":"Exploring the Zulot Ruins","text":"d12 Encounter 1 Discovered: The unlucky PCs are surprised by a troop of 2d6 Mantids. The Mantids first attack to subdue the intruders, but if more than half their number fall, they fall back, calling for reinforcements.

See handouts A through D. 10 Escaped enslaved person: The PCs find an escaped enslaved person hidden amid the ruins. Once a mercenary captain named Ferik, the enslaved person is now on the verge of death: blistered by the sun, frozen from the desert\u2019s chilly nights, and nearly dehydrated. If given water, the captain recovers and can roughly sketch out the temple, its defenses, and entrances. If treated with kindness, the enslaved person may join the PCs, and at the judge\u2019s discretion, the enslaved person can serve as a replacement PC if the adventurers suffer losses. Otherwise, the weakened enslaved person hangs in the background, following instructions but doing little to aid the PCs.
