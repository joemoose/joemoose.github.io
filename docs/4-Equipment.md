# Equipment
All equipment that your character carries must be listed in an inventory slot. Each character has a maximum of **ten** inventory slots. Most items take up one slot, but items with the **Bulky** tags require two slots.
## Coins
The first 200 coins carried do not take up an inventory slot. Each **additional 200 coins** requires one inventory slot. For example, if you are carrying 1000 coins, you’ll need 4 inventory slots.
## Limited Resources and the Usage Die
When an item described has **Ud** and then a number after its name, it is considered to be a consumable, limited-use item. The ‘**Ud**’ stands for **Usage Die**, the number indicating what size die it is. For example, oil (Ud6) has a Usage Die of 1d6.
When that item is used, its Usage Die should be rolled. If the result is 1–2 then the Usage Die is downgraded to the next smallest die in the following die chain:
**Ud20 > Ud12 > Ud10 > Ud8 > Ud6 > Ud4**
When you roll a 1-2 on a d4, the item is expended and removed from your inventory.
##  Equipment Tags

## Weapon Moves
A weapon can be more than just a damage roll. Cunning warriors use their armament to confuse, disorient, and disadvantage their opponents before moving in for the kill. The weapon moves that follow are examples of what your character might accomplish with ad-hoc deeds, besides just standing toe-to-toe with an enemy and trading blows. Don't fight fair!
Your character can use any of the following moves as long as they're wielding the appropriate weapon. The moves result in only their listed effect and don't generally deal damage unless specified otherwise. A Strength Save is usually required to complete a weapon move.
