# Making Your Character
To create your character, follow these steps.
## 1. Attribute Scores
Your character has three Attributes Scores that measure their physical and mental capabilities.
* **Strength (STR)**: brawn, toughness
* **Dexterity (DEX)**: quickness, precision
* **Willpower (WILL)**: charm, discipline

For each Attribute, in order, roll **3d6**. If you like, you may swap any two scores.
## 2. Hit Protection
**Hit Protection (HP)** measures your character’s capability to avoid life-threatening damage.
* HP is quickly replenished, both during combat and afterwards.
* Wearing armour increases your HP.
* Damage first reduces your HP.
* After your HP is reduced to zero, subsequent damage then reduces your Strength.
* Damage to Strength represents a more severe injury.

Roll **1d6** twice and take the better result for your character’s HP.
## 3. Corruption
As an adventurer, you will encounter all manner of strange and eldritch forces in the dark corners of the world. These powers can physically and mentally corrupt those seeking them out. Some mortals may even bargain with demons for arcane magicks and find their bodies altered in strange ways.
Starting out, your character has **zero corruption**, but this score will increase the more you delve and adventure.

[Background Table]

List all the equipment that your character carries in inventory slots. Your character has a maximum of **ten inventory slots**.
In addition to your starting equipment, your group of characters begins with the following expeditionary resources:
- **Illumination** (torches, lanterns, fuel)
- **Climbing gear** (rope, pitons, gloves)
- **Camping gear** (tents, bedrolls, tarps)
- **Rations** (food, water, mess kits)

Distribute each of these resources across all characters as evenly as possible. Each of these resources is **bulky** (taking two inventory slots). So long as these resources are not used up, assume the party has enough for everyone.
See Equipment for details on the Usage Die for limited use resources and equipment.
### 5. Starting Coin
The world is a farrago of lost civilizations and warring empires. Currencies have risen, fallen, changed, been forgotten, and then usurped by new kingdoms. As such, money in this game is simply “coin.”
Your character starts with **2d6** coin.
The first 200 coins carried do not take up an inventory slot. Each additional 200 coins requires an inventory slot.
### 6. Archetype
Choose an archetype for your character or roll 1d6:
1. Contender
2. Warden
3. Dirtfriend
4. Oraculary
5. Sepluchrite
6. Curator

Take your character’s archetype’s listed bonus gear, base ability, and one prestige ability. Roll 1d6 to determine the particular quirk related to your archetype.
