# Sorcery

The lands contain ancient, evil places filled with all manner of strange, corrupting powers and arcane relics.

## Spell Grimoires

Grimoires contain a single spell and take up one slot in your inventory. Grimoires cannot be transcribed or created; instead, they are recovered from tombs, dungeons, and the forgotten ruins of the land.

To determine the spell contained within a grimoire, roll on the [Spells](6a-Spells.md "Spells") table.

Grimoires sometimes display unusual properties or limitations, such as producing a foul or unearthly smell when opened, possessing an innate intelligence, or being legible only under moonlight.

Grimoires will attract those who seek sorcerous power, and it is considered dangerous to display them openly.

## Casting Spells and Corruption

Any character can cast a spell by holding a grimoire in one hand and reading its contents aloud. They then add one Fatigue to their inventory and make a Wit Save to avoid Corruption. 

Failure on the Wit Save increases your character's current Corruption level by one. You then roll d20 on the [Corruptions](6b-Corruption.md "Corruptions") table, adding their current Corruption level, to determine what, if any, Corruption manifests.

## Scrolls

Scrolls are identical to Grimoires, however:

- They can be stacked in a single inventory slot.
- They do not add Fatigue when cast.
- They are destroyed upon use.

A Wit Save is required to avoid Corruption upon reading a scroll.

## Relics 

Relics are magical items imbued with sorcerous powers. Using a relic does not add Fatigue. Relics sometimes have a limited number of uses and possibly a recharge condition. 

A Wit Save is required to avoid Corruption upon using a relic.
