# Gunne Misfires

On a Critical miss to hit a target with a dragon-powder gunne, roll 3d6 and refer to the following Misfire table.

| 3d6 | Result |
| :-: | :- |
| 3 | The gunne explodes and is destroyed, dealing half its damage (rounded up) to you. |
| 4 | You get sparks in your eyes. Dexterity and Wit Saves have a Disadvantage until you heal or rest. |
| 5 | You catch on fire, taking d4 damage per round ignoring armour until you put it out. |
| 6â€“15 | The gunne fails to fire. You must take one round fiddling with the mechanism and make a Wit Save if you want to try firing it again. |
| 16 | The gunne is fine, but everyone close by in the same zone must make a Dexterity Save. The character who rolls the highest failed Save is hit by the shot. |
| 17 | The gunne breaks. It will need to be thoroughly cleaned and repaired before being used again. The cost of repair is 20% of its price. |
| 18 | The gunne explodes and is destroyed, dealing half its damage (rounded up) to you and everyone close by in the same zone. |
