# Scars

When damage reduces your character’s HP to *exactly* zero, they are sometimes changed irrevocably. 

Based on the damage suffered in the attack, see the following table for the resulting Scar.

| Damage | Scar |
| :----: | :--- |
| 1 | **Lasting Scar**: Roll d6 &#124; 1: Ear, 2: Eye, 3: Chest, 4: Hands, 5: Legs, 6: Neck. Roll d6. If the result is higher than your maximum HP, take the new result. |
| 2 | **Rattling Blow**: You’re disoriented and shaken. Take one round to refocus. Roll d6. If the result is higher than your maximum HP, take the new result. |
| 3 | **Walloped**: You’re sent flying and land flat on your face, winded. Add one **Fatigue** to your inventory. Then, roll d6 and add the result to your maximum HP. |
| 4 | **Broken Limb**: Roll d6 &#124; 1-2: Arm, 3-4: Leg, 5: Rib, 6: Skull. Once fully healed, roll 2d6. If the total is higher than your maximum HP, take the new result. |
| 5 | **Diseased**: You’re afflicted with a repulsive, uncomfortable infection. When you recover, roll 2d6. If the total is higher than your maximum HP, take the new result. |
| 6 | **Reorienting Head Wound**: Roll d6 &#124; 1-2: Brawn, 3-4: Finesse, 5-6: Intellect. Roll 3d6. If the result is higher than your current Ability score, take the new result. |
| 7 | **Hamstrung**: You can barely move until you heal and rest. |
| 8 | **Deafened**: You cannot hear anything until you heal and rest. |
| 9 | **Warped**: An unknown part of your psyche is knocked loose. Increase your Corruption level by one.<br />Roll d6 &#124; Make an Ability Save for: 1-2: Brawn, 3-4: Finesse, or 5-6: Intellect.<br />If you succeed, roll 3d6. If the result is higher than your current Ability score, take the new result. Otherwise, roll a [Corruption](6b-Corruption.md). |
| 10 | **Sundered**: Roll 1d6 &#124; 1: Arm, 2: Leg, 3–4 Hand, 5–6 foot. The appendage is torn off, crippled, or useless. Make an Intellect save. If you succeed, increase your maximum Intellect by 1d4 (to a maximum of 18). |
| 11 | **Mortal Wound**: You are knocked unconscious and out of the action. Add a **Fatigue** to your inventory. You’ll die soon unless revived. Upon recovery, roll 2d6. Take the new result as your maximum HP. |
| 12 | **Doomed**: Somehow, you survived the blow. If your next Brawn Save to avoid Critical Injury is a failure, you die instantly and horribly. If you pass, roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your maximum HP, take the new result. |
| 13+ | **Outsider** You should have have died, but someone or *something* intervened. Roll d6 &#124; 1–2: gain a [Demon Aspect](6b-Corruption.md#demon), 3–4: gain a [Serpent Aspect](6b-Corruption.md#serpent), 5–6: gain an [Old Ones Aspect](6b-Corruption.md#oldOne). |
