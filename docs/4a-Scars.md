# Scars

When damage to your character reduces their HP to *exactly* zero, they are sometimes changed irrevocably. 

Based on the damage suffered in the attack, reference the resulting Scar on the following table.

| Damage | Scar |
| :----: | :--- |
| 1 | **Lasting Scar**: Roll 1d6 &#124; 1: Ear, 2: Eye, 3: Chest, 4: Hands, 5: Legs, 6: Neck. Roll 1d6. If the result is higher than your maximum HP, take the new result. |
| 2 | **Rattling Blow**: You’re disoriented and shaken. Take one round to refocus. Roll 1d6. If the result is higher than your maximum HP, take the new result. |
| 3 | **Walloped**: You’re sent flying and land flat on your face, winded. Add a **Fatigue** to your inventory. Then, roll 1d6. Add the result to your maximum HP. |
| 4 | **Broken Limb**: Roll 1d6 &#124; 1-2: Arm, 3-4: Leg, 5: Rib, 6: Skull. Once mended, roll 2d6. If the total is higher than your maximum HP, take the new result. |
| 5 | **Diseased**: You’re afflicted with a repulsive, uncomfortable infection. When you recover, roll 2d6. If the total is higher than your maximum HP, take the new result. |
| 6 | **Reorienting Head Wound**: Roll 1d6 &#124; 1-2: Strength, 3-4: Dexterity, 5-6: Wit. Roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your current Ability score, take the new result and add one point of Corruption. |
| 7 | **Hamstrung**: You can barely move until you heal and rest. After recovering, make a Dexterity save. If you succeed, increase your maximum Dexterity by 1d4. Otherwise, lose 1d2 from your maximum Wit. |
| 8 | **Deafened**: You cannot hear anything until you heal and rest. After recovering, make a Wit save. If you succeed, increase your maximum Wit by 1d4. Otherwise, lose 1d2 from your maximum Wit. |
| 9 | **Re-brained**: An unknown part of your psyche is knocked loose. Roll for a Corruption and then roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your maximum Wit, take the new result. |
| 10 | **Sundered**: Roll 1d6 &#124; 1: Arm, 2: Leg, 3–4 Hand, 5–6 foot. The appendage is torn off, crippled, or useless. Make a Wit save. If you succeed, increase your maximum Wit by 1d6. |
| 11 | **Mortal Wound**: You are knocked unconscious and out of the action. Add a **Fatigue** to your inventory. You’ll die soon unless revived. Upon recovery, roll 2d6. Take the new result as your maximum HP. |
| 12+ | **Doomed**: You should have died, but somehow you survived. If your next Strength Save to avoid Critical Damage is a failure, you die instantly and horribly. If you pass, roll for a [Corruption](6b-Corruption.md "Corruption") and then roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your maximum HP, take the new result. |
