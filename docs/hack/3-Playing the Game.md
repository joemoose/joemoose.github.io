# Playing the Game
The core of this game is a conversation between the players and the GM. The GM describes the player’s current situation. Then the player’s ask questions and tell what their characters do. The GM explains the results of your actions; the players react and describe more activities, and so on.
In the case where the outcome of your character’s actions are not immediately apparent, or the activity is inherently risky, the GM may ask that you roll dice to determine the results.
The GM will answer your questions and will always respect your freedom of choice. The GM will certainly provide challenges, obstacles, and situations to solve and overcome, but the game is not a story simply narrated by the GM. Instead, it’s an interactive fiction built upon you and your fellow players’ decisions.
## Actions and Attribute Saves
Actions are anything your character does when interacting with the world, whether it’s haggling with an innkeeper, avoiding a trap, crossing swords with a villain, or invoking powers of an elder god.
Your description of what your character is doing determines the outcome of their Actions. Your character's Actions always succeed as you describe unless there's potential for risk or consequence to the narrative.
### Attribute Saves
When your character's Action is risky or could change the course of the narrative, your GM may call for an **Attribute Save**. Your GM tells you what Attribute is relevant and you then roll **1d20**. If the result of the roll is *less than* your character’s Attribute Score, the Action **succeeds**. Otherwise, it **fails**.
### Advantage and Disadvantage
If careful preparation reduces the risk of an Action or other situational factors, your GM may grant **advantage** on your Save. If so, you roll an extra d20 and use the best result of the two dice.
If an Action has multiple advantages, it may no longer be considered risky and therefore might not require a Save.
Conversely, if the Action is made riskier by great haste, lack of planning or appropriate gear, or other situational factors, your GM may require **disadvantage** on your Save. If so, you roll an extra d20 and use the worst result of the two dice.
Attribute Saves with both advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out and are rolled as usual with one d20.
### Opposed Actions
If opponents are attempting the same Action, the Action is **Opposed**. For example, your character is holding a door closed while an enemy is forcing it open. To determine an outcome, **both opponents** make Saves, and the **lowest** roll succeeds. 
### Aiding and Interfering
Player characters can come to the **aid** of their companions to help make an Action succeed. Everyone involved makes individual Attribute Saves, and the best roll decides the outcome. All characters aiding with the Action potentially share any adverse consequences of a failed Save.
Conversely, player characters can **interfere** with another player character’s actions and attempt to prevent it from succeeding. Everyone involved makes an Ability Save, and the worst roll decides the outcome. 
### Group Saves
An adventuring group of player characters will sometimes need to make an Ability Save as a whole to accomplish a collective Action. In these cases, a single player rolls the Ability Save.
If it’s evident in the narrative which player character best determines the outcome, that character rolls the Ability Save. For example, if the group is petitioning a clan chieftain for a favor, the spokesperson makes a Wit Save. 
If a group Ability Save doesn't have a delineated character to decide an outcome, the roll then falls to the player character in the group who is most likely to cause the Save to **fail**. For example, the player character with the lowest Talent would roll a Save for the party sneaking past a sleeping dragon. This particular group Save would be a good time for friends to come to their aid.
## Time and Distance
Time and distance are abstracted and flexible, depending on the current narrative. 
### Time
The game measures time in three durations: Round, Turn, and Watch.
* **Round** is the time scale for combat. Each Round is less than a minute.
* **Turn** is the time scale for exploration. Each Turn is around 10 minutes, enough time to explore a room and perform an Action or two. 
* **Watch** is the time scale used when traveling. Each Watch is 36 Turns or about 6 hours.

### Distance
The game measures distance with four zones or bands: Close, Near, Far, and Distant. Your character can move between adjacent zones in one Round. 
* **Close** means that the opponents are within striking distance of hand-held melee weapons.
* **Near** means that the opponents are out of striking distance for melee weapons but within range of thrown weapons, ranged weapons, and spells.
* **Far** means the opponents are even further apart, out of range for melee and thrown weapons, but within range of ranged weapons or spells.
* **Distant** means the opponents are entirely out of reach of any weapon or magic.

## Combat
In each round of combat, your character can move and take one Action or forgo taking Action and move twice.
### Initiative
Who attacks first is determined as follows:
- If your opponent is surprised, your character acts before them.
- If an opponent is not surprised, make a Dexterity Save to go before them.

Afterwards, roll a Dexterity Save each round to determine who acts first until the encounter is over. The subsequent roll may result in one side taking two consecutive actions.
### Attacks
Attacks always hit. The attacker just rolls their weapon’s damage die and deals that much damage to their opponent.
In some situations that make an attack more or less deadly, the GM may decide that your character’s damage is **Enhanced** or **Impaired**.
- If an attack is Enhanced, such as attacking an unaware target, you deal one die **higher** in the damage dice chain.
- If the attack is Impaired, such as firing through cover, deal one die **lower** in the damage dice chain.

See the following Damage Dice Chain section for details.
### Damage Dice Chain
A weapon’s damage increases to the next highest die if the attack is Enhanced. Conversely, a weapon’s damage decreases to the next lowest die if the attack is Impaired. Moving up and down between damage dice is called the **Damage Dice Chain**, represented as follows: **d2 > d3 > d4 > d6 > d8 > d10 > 2d6 > 2d8**
For example, your character wields a greatsword that does 1d10 damage. If your attack is enhanced, the damage increases to a 2d6 roll. If your attack is impaired, the damage roll decreases to a 1d8 roll.
### Advantage & Disadvantage
Depending on situational circumstances, your GM may also specify that attacks have advantage or disadvantage. In this case, roll an extra damage die and take the best or worst result, respectively.
Some situations might combine impaired or enhanced damage with advantage and disadvantage.
For example, attacking from a well-planned ambush grants advantage on the opening actions. However, if you fire a ranged weapon through intervening cover, the damage is impaired. In this case, the impaired damage die drops to the next lowest die in the damage dice chain, but the die is rolled twice with advantage, and the best result applied. 
### Multiple Attacks
If multiple allies in the same zone attack the same opponent, roll each damage separately, but deal only the single highest result.
### Blast Damage
Attacks with the blast quality affect all targets in the same zone, rolling damage separately for each affected character. Blast refers to anything from explosions to massive cleaving onslaughts to the impact of a meteorite. 
### Deeds
**Deeds** are ad-hoc heroic maneuvers your character might attempt during combat. Examples include disarming an opponent, swinging from a chandelier to knock a target over, leaping onto the back of a giant, or shouting a ferocious battle cry to unnerve the enemy. Most any deed you can describe within the fiction of the narrative is possible, per GM ruling.
You declare your character’s deed and do not roll damage. Instead, you make an Attribute Save that determines whether your character accomplishes the heroic deed. If the opponent is aware of the impending deed, they can then make an Attribute Save to avoid the result.
Deeds are crucial to surviving a battle. Standing toe-to-toe with an enemy and trading blows might work, but you’ll be taking a considerable risk. Remember that all attacks hit and you always roll damage—this applies to your opponent’s attack as well. Coordinate your party’s actions and deeds. Fight dirty. Don’t give an opponent a chance to defeat you. For examples of possible deeds, see the Weapon Moves section. With a crafty deed, the fight might be over before it starts.
#### Critical Deed Saves
If you roll a “1” or a “20” on your Save for completing a deed, see the following outcomes.
- If you roll a “1,” the deed automatically succeeds without a chance for your opponent to avoid it and you roll weapon damage as well, if applicable.
- If you roll a “20,” the deed automatically fails, and the intended result happens to your character instead. You can make a Save to avoid the deed’s effect.

### Sundered Shields
If your character is using a shield, you can choose to **sunder** your shield to ignore all damage from a **single** attack that Round. Afterwards, the shield is no longer useable.
## Damage, Death, and Debilities
Damage first reduces your character’s HP. After HP is reduced zero, subsequent damage then reduces your Strength. If the damage to HP would reduce HP lower than zero, the extra damage is applied immediately to Strength. Note that an attack that reduces HP to exactly zero has a notable impact. See the Scars table.
### Ability Loss
After taking damage to Strength, you roll a Strength Save. If your Save fails, the damage inflicted is a **critical injury** and your character suffers the **Injured** and **Dazed** debilities. 
Loss of HP represents general wear and tear that’s quickly restored and not life-threatening. Damage to Strength means grievous harm. Some creatures, poisons, diseases, or spells can also damage your character’s other Attributes.
Damage to any Attribute score is potentially grave.
- If **Strength** is reduced to zero, your character dies. It’s time to roll a new character. 
- If **Dexterity** is reduced to zero, your character can no longer make use of their limbs.
- If **Willpower** is reduced to zero, your character is stricken with madness. The GM might determine their actions until your Willpower is restored.
### Debilities
**Debilities** are ongoing adverse conditions affecting your character.
Place a debility in one of your character’s available **inventory slots**. If there aren’t any open slots, drop an item to free up space. Some debilities also have additional effects, such as disadvantage on Saves. 
Remove the debility only after meeting the **Removal** requirement, usually a Short or Long Rest.
Multiple instances of the same debility are not applied.
| Debility | Effect | Removal |
| - | - | - |
| **Befuddled** | Given to characters who suffer damage to Willpower. Willpower Saves have Disadvantage. | Take a Short Rest. |
| **Dazed** | Given to characters who suffer critical injury to Strength or stunning attacks. Characters can take no actions in combat except to attempt to regain their senses. | Make a Strength Save. |
| **Exhausted** | Given to characters who go without rest for a day or as a consequence for extended physical exertion. | Sleep for a Watch. |
| **Hungry** | Given to characters who go a day without consuming a ration. | Eat a meal. |
| **Injured** | Given to characters who suffer critical injury to Strength. Strength and Dexterity Saves have Disadvantage. | Recover all lost Strength and take a Long Rest. |
| **Panicked** | Given to characters who face particularly terrifying creatures or magic. Requires Willpower Save to approach the source of fear. | Take a Short Rest. |
| **Shaky** | Given to characters who suffer damage to Dexterity. Dexterity Saves have disadvantage. | Take a Short Rest. |
| **Sick** | Given to poisoned characters or characters who contract a disease. All Saves have disadvantage. | Use a cure or antidote, such as a healing potion, or after the sickness has run its natural course. |

### Replacement Characters
In the untimely event that your character perishes, roll up a new character. The GM will work your replacement character into the narrative as quickly as possible.

## Rest and Recovery
Your characters can recover from damage to their HP and Abilities by various means, including (1) **rallying** during combat, (2) taking a **short rest** after a battle, (3) eating **rations**, (4) using **healing** equipment or magic (5) **sleeping** for a Watch, and (6) taking a **long rest** in a safe location.

## Character Advancement
Your character improves their abilities by successfully completing **Expeditions**. 
### Expeditions
An Expedition is a trek into an unknown or dangerous locale with a clear goal, such as exploring a mysterious environment, confronting a potent threat, or finding a mysterious artifact. A successful expedition is simply one that returns to Civilization with something to show for it. You might return with treasure, a terrible secret, or just a good story.
### Improving HP, Attributes, and Abilities
Each time you complete an expedition, you can either increase your maximum HP, increase one Attribute Score, or select a new Prestige Ability from your archetype.
If you elect to improve your HP or an Attribute Score, roll **3d6** and refer to the following outcomes. Otherwise, choose your new archetype Prestige Ability.
 - If you choose to **improve HP** and the roll is higher than your current maximum HP (without armour bonuses), increase your HP by half the difference, rounding up. 
 - If you choose to **improve an Ability** and the roll is higher than your current maximum Ability score by 1.

For example, you roll a 13. If you had selected to increase a 6 HP score, your new HP is 10. If you had chosen to raise a 10 Strength score, your new Strength is 11.
If the roll is equal to or less than the current HP or attribute score, the stat is not improved. It’s time to embark on a new expedition.
### Warbands
Large groups of similar combatants fighting together are treated as individuals. 
- When a Warband takes critical damage, it is routed. When it reaches 0 STR, it is destroyed.
- Attacks against Warbands by individuals are impaired unless they deal blast damage. 
- Attacks against individuals by Warbands are enhanced and always deal blast damage.

### Lackeys
Player characters can hire lackeys to aid their expeditions in various ways.
- To create a lackey, roll 2d6 for each attribute, then give them 1 HP and a simple d6 weapon.
- Lackeys have six inventory slots and can only hold a single bulky item.
- Hiring a lackey costs 5d10 coin and an additional 2d10 coin for each return to a safe settlement.
