*(Working Title)*
***DRAFT PLAYERâ€™S GUIDE***
*The KNAVish GLOGular ODDity* is a role-playing game of picaresque sword & sorcery fantasy for one referee and a handful of players. Players take control of wandering scoundrels and adventurers, exploring a dark and eldritch world to claim great wealth, expand their renown, and achieve personal goals. The game system is adapted by Zachary Taylor from a bedrock of Old School Renaissance creativity and trailblazers.
