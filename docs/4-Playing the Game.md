# Playing the Game

The core of this game is a conversation between players and GM. The GM describes the players’ current situation. The players then ask questions and tell what their characters do. The GM explains the results of the players’ actions; the players react and describe more activities, and so on.

Suppose the outcome of your character’s actions is not immediately apparent, or the activity is risky. In that case, the GM may ask that you roll dice to determine the results.

The GM will answer your questions and will always respect your freedom of choice. The GM will certainly provide challenges, obstacles, and situations to solve and overcome. Still, the game is not a story narrated by the GM. Instead, it’s an interactive fiction built upon your and your fellow players’ decisions.

## Actions and Ability Saves

**Actions** are anything your character does when interacting with the world, whether it’s haggling with an innkeeper, avoiding a trap, crossing swords with a villain, or invoking the powers of an elder god.

Your description of what your character is doing determines the outcome of their Actions. Your character's Actions always succeed as you describe unless there's potential for risk or consequence to the narrative.

### Ability Saves

When your character's Action is risky or could change the narrative, your GM may call for an **Ability Save**. Your GM tells you what Ability is relevant, and you then roll **d20**. If the result is **less than** your character’s Ability score, the Action **succeeds**. Otherwise, it **fails**. 

Regardless of Ability scores, a roll of 1 always succeeds, while a 20 always fails.

### Advantage and Disadvantage

Suppose careful preparation reduces the risk of an Action or other situational factors. In that case, your GM may grant an **Advantage** on your Ability Save. If so, you roll an extra d20 and take the **lowest** single result of the two dice.

If an Action has multiple advantages, it may no longer be considered risky and therefore might not require an Ability Save.

Conversely, suppose the Action is made riskier by great haste, lack of appropriate gear, or other factors. In that case, your GM may require a **Disadvantage** on your Ability Save. If so, you roll an extra d20 and take the **highest** single result of the two dice.

Ability Saves with both Advantages and Disadvantages are rolled as usual with one d20.

### Impact and Fictional Positioning

With Advantage, your dice roll certainly has an increased chance of success. Still, the *outcome* of your successful action might also be improved. An advantageous success has more impact on the narrative than a success for the same action made without any advantageous preparation. Similarly, a failure on an advantageous action could be mitigated with lessened consequences.

Conversely, with Disadvantage, your dice roll is, of course, less likely to succeed. Still, even with a successful dice roll, the outcome would have less than ideal results. A failed roll might result in even harsher consequences.

When you take any risky action, the GM determines various degrees of impact on potential outcomes before rolling the dice. Advantageous preparation will improve the effectiveness of your actions on the narrative. Disadvantageous preparation will reduce their effectiveness. Without either advantage or disadvantage, the outcome will be somewhere in the middle.

For example, your party needs to cross a bridge (the only one for miles) that's controlled by a bellicose warlord. You are granted an audience and make your petition. The GM rules a Finesse Save dictates the warlord's decision. If you succeed, you cross, but pay a small tax, like everyone else. On a failure, the bridge is closed, head upstream ten miles to another crossing.

Now, let's assume that you first asked around and learned this warlord is amenable to bribery, so you present him with a fine gift. The GM rules that your Finesse Save has an Advantage, so it's certainly more likely to succeed. However, more than just improving your chances, the GM determines that your advantageous preparation also means the warlord will waive his usual bridge tax. A failure isn't absolute either with the advantageous gift. There's no need to go 10 miles upstream to another crossing. The warlord just needs you to provide him with a small favour before you can cross.

Now consider the disadvantageous situation. It turns out that you are from an enemy nation of this warlord, so the GM rules your petition to cross the bridge has a Disadvantage. Your chances of success are less, but you'll try your luck with no further preparation. With the decreased impact, however, the GM determines that the warlord will let you cross but gouges you with three times his usual tax on a successful roll. On a failed roll, he'll try and arrest you.

Actions have a mechanical component of rolling dice to determine success. Still, the outcomes can be made better or worse by your fictional positioning in the narrative.

### Opposed Actions

If opponents are attempting the same Action, the Action is **Opposed**. For example, your character is holding a door closed while an enemy is forcing it open. To determine an outcome, **both opponents** make Ability Saves, and the **lowest** roll succeeds. 

### Aiding and Interfering

Player characters can come to the **Aid** of their companions to help make an Action succeed. Everyone involved makes separate Abilities Saves, and the best result decides the outcome. All characters aiding with the Action potentially share any adverse consequences of a failed Save.

Conversely, player characters can **Interfere** with another player character’s actions and prevent them from succeeding. Everyone involved makes an Ability Save, and the worst roll decides the outcome. 

## Time and Distance

Time and distance are abstracted and flexible, depending on the current narrative. 

### Time

The game measures time in three durations: Round, Turn, and Watch.

- **Round** is the time scale for combat. Each Round is less than a minute.
- **Turn** is the time scale for exploration. Each Turn is around 10 minutes, enough time to explore a room and perform an Action or two.
- **Watch** is the time scale used when travelling. Each Watch is 36 Turns or about 6 hours.

### Distance

The game measures distance with five zones or ranges: Hand, Close, Near, Far, and Distant. Your character can move between adjacent zones in one Round. 

- **Hand** means the opponents are in physical contact, grappling.
- **Close** means that the opponents are within striking distance of hand-held melee weapons.
- **Near** means that the opponents are out of striking distance for hand-held melee weapons but within range of weapons with a long *reach* quality, such as polearms, thrown weapons, ranged weapons, and spells.
- **Far** means the opponents are even further apart, out of range for melee and thrown weapons, but within range of ranged weapons and spells.
- **Distant** means the opponents are within sight but entirely out of reach of any weapon or spell.

## Combat

In each Round of combat, your character can move and take one Action or forgo taking an Action and move twice.

At the beginning of each round, you declare what your character is doing before dice are rolled.

The GM will indicate the likely actions that your opponents will take.

### Initiative

All players first **declare their actions** for the round and then determine who goes first as follows:

- If your opponent is surprised, your character acts before them.
- If an opponent is not surprised, make a Finesse Save to go before them.

Declare your actions and roll a Finesse Save at the beginning of each new Round to see who goes first. The lowest roll goes first, and then in order of increasing results. Characters who failed the Finesse Save go after their opponents. Continue doing so until the encounter is over. The subsequent roll may result in one side taking two consecutive actions.

### Attacks

Attacks *always* hit. The attacker rolls their weapon’s damage die and deals that much damage to their opponent's HP.

In situations that make an attack either more or less deadly, the GM may decide that your character’s damage is **Enhanced** or **Impaired**.

* If an attack is Enhanced, such as attacking an unaware target, roll your damage die and an extra **d12**. Take the single highest result.
* If the attack is Impaired, such as firing through cover, roll your damage die and an extra **d4**. Take the single lowest result.

### Armour

Before dealing damage to HP, subtract the target's **Armor** rating from the result of your damage roll. Some weapons and types of attacks with the *piercing* quality reduce a target's armour rating for determining damage. Some attacks, such as falling or burning, ignore armour entirely. 

### Sundered Shields

If your character has a shield equipped, you could choose to ignore all damage in an attack by sundering their shield. A sundered shield is destroyed.

### Multiple Attacks

If multiple allies in the same zone attack the same opponent, roll each damage separately, but deal the single highest result.

### Dual Weapons

If your character wields two weapons, roll damage for each, but deal the single highest result.

### Blast

Attacks with a **blast** quality affect all targets in a zone, rolling damage separately for each. Blast refers to anything from explosions to massive cleaving onslaughts to the impact of siege engine projectiles. If unsure how many targets can be affected in the zone, roll the related damage die for the number.

### Heroic Deeds

**Heroic Deeds** are ad-hoc manoeuvres your character might attempt during combat. Examples include:

- Disarming an opponent
- Swinging from a chandelier to knock a target over
- Leaping onto the back of a giant
- Shouting a ferocious battle cry to unnerve the enemy

Any deed you can describe within the fiction of the narrative is possible, per GM ruling.

#### Resolving Deeds

You declare your character’s deed and do not roll damage. Instead, make an Ability Save that determines whether your character accomplishes the heroic deed. 

Deeds are crucial to surviving battle. Standing toe-to-toe with an enemy and trading blows might work, but you’ll be taking a considerable risk. Remember that all attacks hit, and you always roll damage—this applies to your opponent’s attacks as well. Coordinate your party’s actions and deeds. Fight dirty. Don’t give an opponent a chance to defeat you. With a crafty deed, the fight might be over before it starts.

#### Critical Deed Saves

If you roll a one or a twenty on your Ability Save for completing a deed, see the following outcomes.

- On a one, the deed succeeds spectacularly without any chance for your opponent to avoid it, and you also roll weapon damage, if applicable.
- On a twenty, the deed fails miserably, and the intended result happens to your character instead. You might be able to make an Ability Save to avoid the deed’s effect.

### Retreat

Running away from a dire situation requires a Finesse Save, as well as a safe destination to run to.

### Warband

Large groups of similar combatants fighting together are treated as a single unit.

- When a Warband takes a Critical Injury, it is routed. When it reaches zero Brawn, it is destroyed.
- Attacks against Warbands by individuals are **impaired** unless they deal blast damage.
- Attacks against individuals by Warbands are **enhanced** and always deal **blast** damage.

## Damage, Death, and Debilities

Damage first reduces your character’s HP. After HP is zero,  the excess damage then reduces your Brawn Ability. 

Losing HP represents general wear and tear that’s quickly restored and not life-threatening. Damage to Brawn means more grievous harm.

As long as HP is zero, damage is taken to Brawn. 

### Ability Loss

After taking damage to Brawn, roll a Brawn Save. If your Save fails, the damage is a **Critical Injury**. Your character adds a **Fatigue** debility to their inventory and is unconscious and out of the fight until revived. 

Some creatures, poisons, diseases, or spells can potentially damage your character’s other Abilities. 

Damage to any Ability score is potentially grave.

- If **Brawn** is reduced to zero, your character dies. It’s time to roll a new character. 
- If **Finesse** is reduced to zero, your character can no longer make use of their limbs.
- If **Intellect** is reduced to zero, your character is stricken with madness. The GM might determine their actions until the character's Intellect is restored.

### Scars

When damage to your character reduces their HP to *exactly* zero, they are sometimes changed irrevocably. See the [Scars](4a-Scars.md "Scars") table for details.

### Deprivation and Fatigue 

A character **deprived** of a crucial need (such as food or rest) cannot heal HP or Ability scores. Anyone deprived for more than a day adds **Fatigue** to their inventory, one for each day. Each Fatigue occupies one slot and lasts until they can recuperate (such as a whole night's rest in a safe spot). 

Characters can also gain Fatigue by:

- casting spells,
- suffering critical injuries,
- or through events in the narrative.

### Healing 

Resting for a few moments after an encounter restores all lost HP. Ability loss and other serious ailments are more difficult to heal. You can generally recover lost Ability points with a week or two of rest under a healer's care or other sources of appropriate expertise. Some of these services are free, while magical or more expedient means of recovery may come at a cost.
