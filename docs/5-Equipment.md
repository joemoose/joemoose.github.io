# Equipment

All equipment that your character carries must be listed in an inventory slot. Each character has a maximum of **ten** inventory slots.

Prices in the following equipment lists are in silver coins. Barter is typically the means of exchange in small, remote settlements. Coinage is used in larger towns. The gold coin is known but exceedingly rare—fit for kings and dragons. 

The first 200 coins carried do not take up an inventory slot. Each **additional 200 coins** requires one inventory slot. For example, if you are carrying 1000 coins, you’ll need four inventory slots.

**Tags** describe your equipment’s general attributes and functions, such as weight and number of uses. See the following Tags and Equipment lists for details.

## Gear

### Equipment Tags

Tags describe and differentiate equipment. Some tags are purely descriptive, while others specify attributes and effects for the character using the equipment.

| Tag | Description |
| :-- | :---------- |
| *Applied* | It only works when carefully applied to a person or something they eat or drink. |
| *Awkward* | It’s unwieldy and requires space to use. |
| *Dangerous* | It’s easy to get in trouble with it. If you interact with it without proper precautions, the GM may freely invoke the consequences of your foolish actions. |
| *Requires* | It’s useful with a specific minimum Ability. If you don’t meet the requirements, it works poorly, if at all. |
| *Slow* | It takes a minute or two to use. |
| *Touch* | Used by touching it to the target’s skin. |
| *Two-handed* | It takes two hands to use it effectively. |
| *Worn* | To use it, you have to be wearing it. |
| *n Uses* | It can only be used *n* times. |

## Armour

Armour decreases damage from weapon attacks and many other forms of damage. Any character can strap on armour to take advantage of its protective qualities. 

### Armour Tags

Some armour tags are purely descriptive, while others specify attributes and effects for the character using the armour.

| Tag | Description |
| :-- | :---------- |
| *n Armour* | It protects you from harm. Reduce *n* from damage. |
| *Bulky* | Requires 2 inventory slots. |
| *Clumsy* | It's cumbersome or noisy to move around while wearing. Dexterity Saves have a Disadvantage. |
| *Fitted* | Tailored to fit the owner perfectly and removes the *Clumsy* tag. Other wearers would not receive this benefit. Price increases threefold. |
| *Requires* | It's usable with a specific minimum Ability. If you don’t meet the requirements, it works poorly, if at all. |

### Armour Types

| Type | Coin | Tags |
| :--- | ---: | :--- |
| Helmet | 40 | +1 armour, worn |
| Shield | 40 | +1 armour, offhand |

| Plate | 8000 | 4 armour, worn, clumsy, requires 9+ Strength, bulky |

## Weapons

The damage your character inflicts on opponents is determined by the weapons they wield. Your character can use any weapon you see fit. 

### Weapon Tags

Some weapon tags are purely descriptive, while others specify attributes and effects for the character using the weapon.

| Tag | Description |
| :-- | :---------- |
| **General** | |
| *Awkward* | It's unwieldy and requires space to use. |
| *Blast* | Damages all targets in the same zone. |
| *Bulky* | Requires 2 inventory slots. |
| *Forceful* | It can knock an opponent back a pace, maybe even off their feet. |
| *Hand* | Can be used while in physical contact, grappling with an opponent. |
| *Hand and a Half* | It's wielded in either your main hand or with both. If two damage dice are listed, the lower die applies when using one hand, the higher when using both hands. |
| *Ignores Armour* | The damage is not reduced by armour. |
| *Main hand* | It is wielded in your main hand. |
| *Messy* | It does damage in a particularly destructive way, ripping things apart. |
| *Offhand* | Wielded in either your main hand or as a second weapon in your offhand. |
| *n Piercing* | Ignores *n* armour rating. Hardened steel melee weapons add *1 piercing* and the price increases threefold. |
| *Requires* | It's usable with a specific minimum Ability. If you don’t meet the requirements, it works poorly, if at all. |
| *Reload* | It must be reloaded or reset before attacking again. |
| *Shoddy* | It is not well made and has the potential to break in use. Shoddy weapons are generally half the price. |
| *Thrown* | You can throw it at nearby targets, up to one zone away. |
| *Two-handed* | It's wielded with both hands. |
| **Range** | |
| *Close* | It’s useful for attacking something at arm’s reach, plus a foot or two, in the same zone. |
| *Near* | It’s useful for attacking if you can see the whites of their eyes, one zone away. |
| *Far* | It’s useful for attacking something in shouting distance, two zones away. |

## Dragon-Powder Gunnes

Dragon-power gunnes are expensive, exotic, and very loud. Wielded by either the rich or the foolhardy, these strange weapons could very well hail from the infernal planes.

All dragon-powder gunnes are characterized by the following traits:

- **Unwieldy**: All have the *dangerous*, *two-handed*, *awkward*, *reload*, *piercing*, and *bulky* tags, unless otherwise noted. 
- **Inaccurate**: Requires either a Wit or Dexterity Save to hit a target before rolling damage.
- **Dangerous**: A Critical Miss on the Save to hit a target results in a misfire. Roll on the [Misfires](5a-Misfires.md "Misfires") table for the result.
- **Armour Piercing**: All hand-held gunnes or bombs ignore 4 armour. Gunnes moved by two people or cannons ignore all armour.
- **Reloading**: Most gunnes require Powder Shot ammunition and can only be fired once before reloading. Preparing another shot takes 1d2 rounds unless otherwise noted and requires two hands. You can’t reload a gunne if an enemy is within melee range.
- **Noisy**: Igniting dragon-powder has loud and explosive results. Lesser creatures might flee when hearing the shot. Anything more intelligent will notice and investigate.
 
 Remember. If you can buy dragon-powder gunnes, so can everyone else.
