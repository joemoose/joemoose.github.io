# Equipment

All equipment that your character carries must be listed in an inventory slot. Each character has **twelve** inventory slots.

Most items require one slot. Bulky items require two. Small items may sometimes be stacked together in a single slot.

Prices in the following equipment lists are in silver coins. Barter is typically the means of exchange in small, remote settlements. Coinage is used in larger towns. The gold coin is known but exceedingly rare—fit for kings and dragons. 

The first 200 coins carried do not take up an inventory slot. Each **additional 200 coins** requires one inventory slot. For example, if you are carrying 1000 coins, you’ll need four inventory slots.

**Tags** describe your equipment’s general qualities and functions, such as bulky inventory or number of uses. See the following Tags and Equipment lists for details.

| *Cover* | Provides cover against ranged attacks for Impaired damage. |

## Weapons

The damage your character inflicts on opponents is determined by the weapons they wield. Your character can use any weapon you see fit. 

### Weapon Tags

Some weapon tags are purely descriptive, while others specify attributes and effects for the character using the weapon.

| Tag | Description |
| :-- | :---------- |
| **General** | |
| *Awkward* | Unwieldy and requires sufficient space to use. |
| *Blast* | Damages all targets in the zone. |
| *Bulky* | Requires 2 inventory slots. |
| *Forceful* | It can knock an opponent back a pace, maybe even off their feet. |
| *Hand* | Can be used while in physical contact, grappling with an opponent. |
| *Hand and a Half* | Wielded in either your main hand or with both. If two damage dice are listed, the lower die applies when using one hand, the higher when using both hands. |
| *Ignores Armour* | The damage is not reduced by armour. |
| *Main* | It is wielded in your main hand. |
| *Messy* | It does damage in a particularly destructive way, ripping things apart. |
| *Offhand* | Wielded in either your main hand or as a second weapon in your offhand. |
| *n Piercing* | Ignores *n* armour rating. Hardened steel melee weapons add *1 piercing*, and the price increases threefold. |
| *Requires* | Usable only with a specific minimum Ability score. |
| *Reload* | It must be reloaded or reset before attacking again. |
| *Shoddy* | It is not well made and has the potential to break in use. Shoddy weapons are generally half the price. |

| *Two-handed* | Wielded with both hands. |
| **Ranged** | |
| *Close* | It’s useful for attacking something at arm’s reach, plus a foot or two, in the same zone. |

## Dragon-Powder Gunnes

Dragon-powder gunnes are expensive, exotic, and very loud. Wielded by the rich or the foolhardy, these strange weapons could very well hail from the infernal planes.

All dragon-powder gunnes have the following qualities:

- **Unwieldy**: All have the *dangerous*, *two-handed*, *awkward*, and *bulky* tags, unless otherwise noted. 
- **Inaccurate**: Requires either an Intellect or a Finesse Save to hit a target before rolling damage.
- **Perilous**: A Critical Miss on the Save to hit a target results in a misfire. Roll on the [Misfires](5a-Misfires.md "Misfires") table for the outcome.
- **Armour-Piercing**: All hand-held gunnes or bombs ignore 4 armour. Gunnes moved by two people or pack animals ignore all armour.
- **Powerful**: Enhanced attacks with gunnes roll an extra d20, impaired d6.
- **Reloading**: Most gunnes require one load of Powder Shot ammunition and can only be fired once before reloading. Preparing another shot takes 1d2 rounds unless otherwise noted and requires two hands. You can’t reload a gunne if an enemy is within melee range.
- **Noisy**: Igniting dragon-powder has loud and explosive results. Lesser creatures might flee when hearing the shot. Anything more intelligent will notice and investigate.
 
 Remember. If you can buy dragon-powder gunnes, so can everyone else.
