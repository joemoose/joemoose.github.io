# Making Your Character

To create your character, follow these steps.

## 1: Name and Traites

Choose your character's sex and then either choose or roll their name and physical traits on the [Names](3a-Names.md "Names") and [Traits](3b-Traits.md "Traits") tables.

## 2: Abilities

Your character has three Abilities scores that measure their general capabilities.

- **Strength**: brawn, fortitude, vigour
- **Dexterity**: agility, reflexes, speed
- **Wit**: charm, intelligence, perception

For each Ability, in order, roll **3d6**. If you like, you can then swap any two Ability scores.

## 3: Hit Protection

**Hit Protection (HP)** measures your character’s capability to avoid severe damage.

- HP is quickly replenished.
- Damage first reduces your HP.
- After your HP is zero, damage then reduces your Strength.
- Damage to Strength represents a more severe injury.

Roll **1d6** for your character’s HP.

## 4: Corruption

Players dabbling in sorcery slide down a slippery slope. Magic is volatile and warps its practitioners. Some players may want to avoid these corruptions, while others seek it actively.

Your player starts with **zero** corruption.

## 5: Classless

Many games have fixed character classes or roles you must choose to determine your character’s capabilities. However, you are all dungeoneers, explorers, and ne'er-do-wells seeking adventure and glory in this game. Your character can strap on plate armour and swing a battleaxe as readily as they can cast a spell, pick a lock, sneak in the shadows, or traverse a wilderness. The equipment they carry, Ability scores, background, and imagination determine your character's capabilities.

If you’d like to be a warrior, put your highest Ability score in Strength and arm yourself with the best weapons and armour that you can acquire. If you prefer a stealthy rogue, make sure you have lock picks and high Dexterity. Spell grimoires and a high Wit will help you along the path of magical arts. Or perhaps a little of all three?

Alternately, if you would prefer to play a specific character archetype, see the optional [Archetypes](3e-Archetypes.md "Archetypes") table. 

## 6: Background

Either choose or roll your character's background before becoming an adventurer on the [Backgrounds](3c-Backgrounds.md "Backgrounds") table.

Your character's background does not have any particular game effect. The background might suggest something your character knows or a possible contact.

## 7: Starting Equipment

Characters have a total of 10 inventory slots. Most items take up one slot, and small items can sometimes bundle together into a single slot. **Bulky** items take up two slots and are typically two-handed or awkward to carry. 

A character with a full inventory (filling all slots) has their HP reduced to **zero** while encumbered. You cannot carry more items than your inventory allows and must drop excess items.

All PCs begin with:

- Rations (3 days)
- Waterskin (3 days)
- d6 x5 coins

Roll on the [Starting Equipment](/3d-Gear.md "Starting Equipment") tables to determine what additional equipment, armour, and weapon your character owns.

See [Equipment](/5-Equipment.md "Equipment") for details on the items such as armour value, damage die, and inventory slot attributes.
