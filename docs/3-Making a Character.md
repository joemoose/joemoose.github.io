# Making Your Character

To create your character, download a [character sheet](https://joemoose.github.io/Dungeoneers_Character_Sheet.pdf "Character Sheet") and follow these steps, or [randomly generate](https://joemoose.github.io/chargen.html "Character Generator") a character.

## 1: Name and Traits

Choose your character's name and appearance or roll on the [Names](3a-Names.md "Names") and [Traits](3b-Traits.md "Traits") tables.

## 2: Abilities

Your character has three Abilities scores that measure their general capabilities.

- **Brawn**: fortitude, strength, vigour
- **Finesse**: agility, charm, speed
- **Intellect**: intelligence, perception, willpower

For each Ability, in order, roll **3d6**. If you like, you can then swap any two Ability scores.

## 3: Hit Protection

**Hit Protection (HP)** measures your character’s capability to avoid severe damage.

- HP is quickly replenished.
- Damage first reduces your HP.
- After your HP is zero, damage reduces your Brawn.
- Damage to Brawn represents a more severe injury.

Roll **1d6** for your character’s HP.

## 4: Corruption

Players dabbling in sorcery slide down a slippery slope. Magic is volatile and warps its practitioners. Some players may want to avoid these corruptions, while others seek it actively.

Your player starts with **zero** corruption.

## 5: Classless

Many games have fixed character classes or roles you must choose to determine your character’s capabilities. However, you are all dungeoneers, explorers, and ne'er-do-wells seeking adventure and glory in this game. Your character can strap on plate armour and swing a battleaxe as readily as they can cast a spell, pick a lock, sneak in the shadows, or traverse a wilderness. The equipment they carry, Ability scores, and imagination determine your character's capabilities.

If you’d like to be a warrior, put your highest Ability score in Brawn and arm yourself with the best weapons and armour that you can acquire. If you prefer a stealthy rogue, make sure you have lock picks and high Finesse. Spell grimoires and a high Intellect will help you along the path of sorcerous arts. Or perhaps a little of all three?

Alternately, if you would prefer to play a specific character archetype, see the optional [Archetypes](3e-Archetypes.md "Archetypes") table. 

## 6: Background

Either choose or roll your character's occupation before becoming an adventurer on the [Backgrounds](3c-Backgrounds.md "Backgrounds") table.

Your character's background does not have any particular game effect. The background might suggest something your character knows or a possible contact.

## 7: Starting Equipment

Characters have a total of **twelve** inventory slots. Most items take up one slot, and small items can sometimes be bundled together into a single slot. **Bulky** items take up two slots and are typically two-handed, heavy, or awkward to carry. 

A character with a full inventory (filling all slots) has their HP reduced to **zero** while encumbered. You cannot carry more items than your inventory allows and must drop excess items.

All PCs begin with:

- Rations (3 days)
- Waterskin (3 days)
- 2d6 x10 coins

Roll on the [Starting Equipment](3d-Gear.md "Starting Equipment") tables to determine what additional equipment, armour, and weapon your character owns.

See [Equipment](5-Equipment.md "Equipment") for details on the items such as armour value, damage die, and inventory slot attributes.
