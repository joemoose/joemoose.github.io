# Design Principles

The game design assumes the following principles.

**Neutrality**

The GM's role is to portray the rules, situations, NPCs, and narrative while acting as a neutral arbiter.

**Classless**

A single class does not limit a character's role or skills. Instead, the equipment they carry and their experiences define their speciality.

**Death**

Characters may be powerful, but they are also vulnerable to harm in many forms. Death is always around the corner, but it is never random or without warning.

**Fiction First**

Dice do not always reflect an obstacle's difficulty or its outcome. Instead, the GM arbitrates success and failure in dialogue with the players, based on in-world elements.

**Growth**

Characters are changed through in-world advancement, gaining new skills and abilities by surviving dangerous events and overcoming obstacles.

**Player Choice**

Players should always understand the reasons behind the choices they've made, and the GM provides information about potential risks freely and frequently.

**Principles**

The GM and the players agree to general principles that foster a specific play experience defined by critical thinking, exploration, and an emergent narrative.

**Shared Objectives**

Players trust one another to engage with the shared setting, character goals, and party challenges. Therefore, the party is typically working together towards a common goal as a team.

## Principles for Game Masters

GMs abide by these general principles.

**Information**

- Provide helpful information about the game world as the characters explore it.
- Players do not need to roll dice to learn about their circumstances.
- Be helpful and direct with your answers to their questions.
- Respond honestly, describe consistently, and always let them know they can keep asking questions.

**Difficulty**

- Default to context and realism rather than numbers and mechanics.
- If something the players want to do is sincerely impossible, no dice roll will allow them to do it.
- Is what the player describes and how they leverage the situation sensible? Let it happen.
- Ability Saves cover many uncertain situations and are often all that is necessary for risky actions.

**Preparation**

- The game world is organic, malleable, and random. It intuits and makes sharp turns.
- Use random tables and generators to develop situations, not static stories or plots.
- NPCs remember what the PCs say and do and how they affect the world.
- NPCs don't want to die. Infuse their self-interest and will to live into every personality.

**Narrative Focus**

- Emergent experience of play is what matters, not math or character abilities. Give the players weapon trainers and personal quests to facilitate improvement and specialization.
- Pay attention to the needs and wants of the players, then put realistic opportunities in their path.
- A dagger to your throat will kill you, regardless of your expensive armour and special training.

**Danger**

- The game world produces a real risk of pain and death for the player characters.
- Telegraph danger to players when it is present. The more dangerous, the more apparent.
- Put traps in plain sight and let the players take time to figure out a solution.
- Give players opportunities to solve problems and interact with the world.

**Choice**

- Give players a solid choice to force outcomes when the narrative lulls.
- Use binary "so, A or B?" responses when their intentions are vague.
- Work together with this conversational progress to keep the game moving.
- Ensure that the player character's actions leave their mark on the game world.

## Principles for Players

Players abide by these general principles.

**Agency**

- Ability scores and related saves do not define your character. They are tools.
- Don't only ask what your character would do; ask what you would do, too.
- Be creative with your intuition, items, and connections.

**Teamwork**

- Seek consensus from the other players before barreling forward.
- Stay on the same page about goals and limits, respecting each other and accomplishing more as a group than alone.

**Exploration**

- Asking questions and listening to detail is more valuable than any stats, items, or skills you have.
- Take the GM's description without suspicion, but never hesitate to clarify or seek more information.
- There is no single correct way forward.

**Talking**

- Treat NPCs as if they were real people, and rely on your curiosity to safely gain information and solve problems.
- You'll find that most people are interesting and will want to talk things through before getting violent.

**Caution**

- Fighting is a choice and rarely a wise one; consider whether violence is the best way to achieve your goals.
- Try to stack the odds in your favour and retreat when things seem unfavourable.

**Planning**

- Think of ways to avoid your obstacles through reconnaissance, subtlety, and fact-finding.
- Do some research and ask around about your objectives.

**Ambition**

- Set goals and use your resources to take steps forward.
- Expect nothing. Earn your reputation.
- Keep things moving forward and play to see what happens.
