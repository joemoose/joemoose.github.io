## Aspects

Roll d12 to on the corresponding Aspect table to determine the nature of the corrupting Aspect.

Note that upon gaining a **fifth** aspect of one type, your character wholly succumbs to the Corruption of that Aspect and becomes a monster controlled by the GM. It's time to roll a new character.

The fifth Aspect forever transforms the character as follows.

- **Demon Aspect**: The character gains mastery over souls, seeking to ensorcel and enthral the region's leaders and beyond.
- **Old One Aspect**: The character crystallizes into an obsidian pillar of hideous architecture, corrupting the landscape.
- **Serpent Aspect**: The character transforms fully into a slithering abomination, vowing enmity to all who once trusted you.
